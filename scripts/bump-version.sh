# design/README.md "Versioning & release"). The sites that must agree:
#
#   - Cargo.toml  [workspace.package] version
#   - Cargo.toml  in-workspace dependency requirements (path + version)
#   - vscode-bynk/package.json        version + bynkServerVersion ("vX.Y.Z" —
#     the GitHub Release the extension downloads server binaries from)
#   - tree-sitter-bynk/package.json   version
#   - the lockfiles (Cargo.lock, both package-lock.json)
#   - the Bynk Book's current-version banners (the Book, MAJOR.MINOR) —
#     guarded by bynkc/tests/doc_version.rs (Workstream 0)

# The release workflow's verify job refuses a tag that doesn't match all of

# invocations, but there is no hash/lockfile pin for a lockfile-generating call.
