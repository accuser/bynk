# Move the VS Code extension's server pin to a just-published release tag, when
# it should move (#1673). Called by release.yml's `server-pin` job after the
# GitHub Release exists.
#
# The pin names the last shipped *release*, so:
#   - a pre-release tag (`v1.2.3-rc1`) never becomes the pin;
#   - the pin never moves backwards (a re-run, or a late tag of an older
#     version, is a no-op).
# Any other tag shape is refused outright. release.yml's `verify` job already
# rejects a tag that isn't `v<workspace version>[-suffix]`, but this script
# writes to `main`, so it doesn't rely on that.
#
# Usage: scripts/next-server-pin.sh TAG [PACKAGE_JSON]
# Edits PACKAGE_JSON (default vscode-bynk/package.json) in place when the pin
# moves, and prints `move=true` or `move=false` on stdout (a GITHUB_OUTPUT line).
