// #1653: every runtime name an emitted module imports is also exported under
// a `__` alias, and emitted code imports only the alias. A Bynk identifier
// cannot start with `_`, so no user type, function or binding in the
// importing module can collide with an imported runtime name (a user
// `type JsonValue` beside an import of `JsonValue` would not compile).
// The plain names stay exported for the runtime's own tests.
