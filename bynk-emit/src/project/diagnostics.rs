// relocated verbatim (Decision C) to `bynk-check/src/analysis.rs`, alongside
// the new `bynk-check`-native analysis entry point that also needs to build
// one. Re-exported here so `crate::project::{ProjectAnalysis, ...}` (this
// module's own `pub use` chain, `project.rs:80`) — and every downstream
// caller, including `bynk-ide`'s `bynk_emit::project::ProjectAnalysis`
// import — keeps resolving unchanged. `Mode`/`ErrorSink`/`ProjectFailure`
// below are unaffected: `Mode` and `ProjectFailure` are pipeline-driving
// facts specific to `bynk-emit`'s two callers (`compile_project`/
// `analyse_project_with`), not project-model or checker output.

// had to travel with them (the same "shared logic pulls its own types down
// with it" reasoning `UnitTable`/`ConsumedType` already went through when
// `symbols.rs` moved). Re-exported at this crate-private path so every
// existing `bynk-emit`-internal call site is unchanged.
