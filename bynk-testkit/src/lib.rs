//! Content-ownership track (#1086) slice 3: the cross-crate replacement for
//! `diagnose_project(&root, &HashMap::new())` and bare
//! `CompileOptions::single`/`::split`'s reliance on `bynk-emit`'s disk
//! fallback (`design/tracks/content-ownership.md` §3.3, §4).
//!
//! Every helper here walks a project exactly the way production code already
//! does — `bynk_ide::discover_files` for `diagnose_project*`-style callers,
//! the same `bynk_emit::project::Roots` a `CompileOptions` will itself
//! compile for `compile_options_*` — and reads every file into a complete
//! sources map, instead of reimplementing the walk. There is no second
//! resolution to drift from the first: a test built on these helpers cannot
//! silently miss a file because this crate's notion of "the project's files"
//! diverged from the compiler's own.
//!
//! Dev-only: invisible to `fs_below_driver`'s probe
//! (`design/greenfield-status.md`), which is scoped to the crates below the
//! driver (`bynk-emit`, `bynk-ide`, `bynk-fmt`) — not to dev-only crates like
//! this one, which is why this file's own real `std::fs` reads (`read_all`,
//! the `bynk.toml` read below) never register, not because the probe walks
//! only production code.
