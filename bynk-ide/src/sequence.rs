//! #846: the sequence-diagram query.
//!
//! Classifies a handler body's calls into runtime-participant lifelines —
//! consumed capabilities, calls into consumed contexts, and agents (including
//! same-context agents) — for the "Show Sequence Diagram" VS Code feature.
//! Everything else (commons fns, context-local fns, methods, constructors)
//! folds into the entry participant's own activation: no message is emitted
//! for the call, and — because this repo's resolver does not inline call
//! bodies either — a lifeline call written inside a commons `fn`'s own body is
//! invisible to this walk. That is a stated Tier-1 limitation, not a bug: see
//! `design/pending/sequence-diagram-846.md`.
//!
//! A pure, read-only IDE query: it never touches the checker's hot path
//! (`bynk_check::checker::check_handler_body`) and is built on the exhaustive
//! `expr_children`/`statement_exprs` walkers only insofar as this module's own
//! statement dispatch mirrors their coverage of [`Statement`] — a new
//! `Statement` variant is a compile error here, in `Builder::walk_block`'s
//! `match`, not a silent gap.
//!
//! Cross-context/agent calls are boundary-stop (Decision C): one `Call` +
//! one `Return` message: the callee's own body is never walked, even where
//! reachable (an agent's handlers are visible via [`ContextSequenceInfo::agents`]).
