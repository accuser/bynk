//! #855: the wire-contract peek — the model behind "hover a service handler"
//! and "Show Wire Contract". Renders `bynk_check::wire::WireModel` (the
//! same IR `bynk-emit`'s codec generation consumes) narrowed to *one*
//! handler, plus the facts the IR does not carry: the request envelope
//! shape, the cross-context contract form + hash (`on call` only), and the
//! HTTP response set a route can actually answer with.
//!
//! **Handler resolution** mirrors `bynk-lsp/src/sequence_request.rs`'s
//! `sequence_model_at`: re-parse the committed snapshot with
//! `parse_unit_with_recovery`, find the `Handler` whose span contains the
//! cursor. The re-parsed `Handler` supplies spans/body; the **retained**
//! [`ContextBoundaryInfo`] supplies the type table — a single-file re-parse
//! cannot see a `uses` target's types, which is the whole reason that table
//! is retained project-wide (Phase 3).
//!
//! **Provenance.** [`bynk_check::wire::Provenance`] distinguishes a type this
//! module owns from one reached through another unit. `ContextBoundaryInfo`'s
//! `types` table is `combined_types_for(unit, …)` — *this* unit's own type
//! namespace, own declarations plus its `uses` targets' — the exact table
//! `own_contract_hashes` (`bynk-emit/src/project.rs`) hashes a service's
//! contract through. Every name resolvable through it is therefore this
//! unit's *own* view of its boundary: `Provenance::Owned` throughout. A
//! genuinely `Consumed` type (reached through a `consumes <other context>`,
//! not a `uses <commons>`) never appears here — that is a *caller's* view of
//! another unit's boundary, not this handler's own, and is out of scope for
//! a peek that answers "what does this handler send and receive".
//!
//! **Scope.** Service handlers only. An agent's `on call` handler crosses a
//! Durable-Object RPC boundary too, but the issue's worked examples (an HTTP
//! route, a cross-context `on call`) are both service handlers, and
//! `ContextBoundaryInfo` does not retain agents' own handler bodies in a form
//! this module needs. Left for a later slice if an agent peek is wanted.
