//! P8.4 (#1515): a durable path↔`FileId` interning table plus one shared,
//! content-keyed parse cache — settled by ADR 0413 as the fix for R3.13's
//! own file level. Replaces `bynk-ide`'s `PROJECT_UNIT_CACHE`
//! (`bynk-check` cannot depend on `bynk-ide`, so the cache the diagnostics
//! path (`bynk_check::analysis::analyse_project` → `phase_parse` →
//! [`crate::discovery::parse_sources`]) actually needs has to live here, one
//! layer down) and gives `bynk_check::project_model::phase_parse` a `FileId`
//! that survives across separate analysis calls instead of resetting to
//! zero on every one ([DECISION B]).
//!
//! [DECISION A] (ADR 0413): one cache, `Ast(FileId)`, not a separate
//! `Tokens(FileId)` cache — neither consumer this slice migrates reads a
//! token stream independently of the parse it feeds.
//!
//! [DECISION B]: the interning table is `path ↔ FileId`
//! (`HashMap<PathBuf, FileId>`, no `index_vec` crate — matching P8.1's own
//! "no new indexing infrastructure" posture); the parse cache keys on the
//! interned `FileId` and invalidates by content equality, mirroring
//! `PROJECT_UNIT_CACHE`'s own proven scheme exactly.
//!
//! [DECISION C]: one slice, one cache. `PROJECT_UNIT_CACHE` is deleted
//! (`bynk-ide/src/completion.rs`), not left running alongside this one —
//! two independently-invalidated caches of the same fact is the exact "no
//! fact in two hand-synced copies" defect this trajectory's phase 1 already
//! named as a standing invariant.
//!
//! [DECISION D] (new — neither the issue nor ADR 0413 examined this):
//! **`ExprId` must be durably allocated too, from a counter that never
//! resets, for the same reason `FileId` must be.** `parser::
//! parse_units_with_warnings_from`'s own doc comment names the hazard this
//! closes one level up: a multi-file commons merges sibling files' methods
//! into one `check_record` call, and two independently zero-based files
//! would collide on the same `ExprId` in the same `expr_types` map
//! (`collect_unit_methods`, caught live by finding #28). That hazard is
//! usually avoided by threading one counter across every file **within a
//! single `phase_parse` call**. Caching a file's parsed `SourceUnit`
//! *across calls* reopens it one level up: if call 2 serves file A from
//! cache (keeping its `ExprId`s from call 1's counter position) while
//! freshly parsing changed file B from a counter that started over at 0,
//! A's and B's `ExprId`s collide in call 2's own `expr_types` map — the
//! identical defect class, now triggered by caching rather than by two
//! files in one call. Fixed the same way `FileId` is: `next_expr_id` lives
//! in this module's own durable state, advanced only on an actual parse
//! (a cache hit consumes no new ids, since the cached `SourceUnit`'s own
//! ids are already fixed), never reset. Global uniqueness across the whole
//! process trivially implies uniqueness within any one call, so this is a
//! strict strengthening of the existing guarantee, not a new one.
//!
//! [DECISION E] (new): this cache stores the **strict** parse
//! (`parser::parse_units_with_warnings_from`, `recover_mode: false`) — the
//! one the build/diagnostics path needs, since a build must never silently
//! succeed on broken syntax by reading a best-effort recovered AST. `bynk
//! -ide::completion`'s own recovery-tolerant parsing
//! (`parser::parse_unit_with_recovery`) is a genuinely different parser
//! configuration, not just a different entry point over the same result —
//! for syntactically **clean** source the two produce the identical AST
//! (there is nothing to recover from), so completion reads this cache
//! directly for the common case; only when the cached/fresh strict result
//! actually carries errors does completion fall back to its own local,
//! uncached recovery-parse for that one file (`bynk_ide::completion`'s own
//! `parse_source_unit`, calling `parser::parse_unit_with_recovery` directly
//! — not part of this crate) — the rare case (another project file mid-edit
//! elsewhere, not the buffer under the cursor, which this cache was never
//! in the path for to begin with) traded for never caching two different
//! parser configurations' output under one key.
