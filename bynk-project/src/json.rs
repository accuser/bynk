//! The one JSON string escaper for every manifest `bynk-emit` hand-renders.
//!
//! Several build outputs are JSON that `bynk-emit` writes by hand rather than
//! via serde (`bynk-contracts.json`, `bynk-secrets.json`, `package.json`, the
//! source map): the shapes are a handful of fields each, and staying
//! serde-free keeps the dependency footprint honest. What they must share is
//! the escaping — every one of them interpolates text that originated in
//! Bynk source (a secret name from a `StrLit`, an adapter's npm package
//! name, a file path), so as far as the renderer is concerned the input is
//! arbitrary.
//!
//! This lived as four near-copies, one per rendering module. Three agreed;
//! the `package.json` one escaped only `"` and `\`, so an adapter-declared
//! package name or version range carrying a control character emitted a
//! literal control character inside a JSON string — a parse error, i.e. an
//! invalid `package.json` in the build output. One definition means a fix
//! like that cannot land in three places and miss the fourth.
//!
//! P4.0 (#1113, [DECISION C]): moved here from `bynk-emit/src/json.rs` so
//! `bynk-project`'s own `paths::render_package_json` (its sole in-crate use)
//! doesn't need a dependency back on `bynk-emit`; `bynk-emit`'s four other
//! call sites (`secrets.rs`, `contracts.rs`, `source_map.rs`, `emit.rs`) now
//! depend on this copy instead of a crate-local one, one definition either
//! way.
