# Bynk LSP — Specification

A Language Server Protocol implementation for Bynk. Provides syntax highlighting (via tree-sitter, specified separately in `bynk-tree-sitter-spec.md`), live diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, formatting, and a status-bar integration. Initial scope is VS Code only.

This is the first tooling increment for Bynk — a pause from language development to make the language usable in practice. The compiler reaches v0.5 (intra-context behavioural layer); the LSP makes that capability accessible through an editor.

---

## 1. Scope

### In scope

- **Project discovery** via `bynk.toml` at the project root.
- **Tree-sitter syntax highlighting** (specified in `bynk-tree-sitter-spec.md`).
- **Live diagnostics** — compile errors and warnings shown as the user types, with debouncing. Configurable to on-save for users on slow machines.
- **Hover** — type information, declarations, and doc blocks shown on cursor hover.
- **Go-to-definition** — F12 / Cmd-click jumps from a name to its declaration, across files in a project.
- **Format-on-save** — canonical formatting applied when files are saved; available as a manual command.
- **`bynkc fmt` CLI command** — format Bynk source files from the command line.
- **Document symbols** — outline view of a file's declarations, shown in VS Code's outline pane.
- **Status-bar integration** — VS Code status bar shows the project name and Bynk compiler version.
- **VS Code extension** packaged for local sideload.
- **References & rename** *(v0.25, §3.8–3.9)* — binding-index-backed, project-wide.
- **Quick-fix code actions** *(v0.26, §3.10)* — from the diagnostics' structured suggestions.
- **Workspace symbol search & document highlights** *(v0.26, §3.11–3.12)* — index queries.
- **Inlay hints** *(v0.27, §3.13)* — inferred-type hints from the analysis round's harvested set.
- **Semantic tokens** *(v0.28, §3.14)* — resolution-aware highlighting from the binding index.

### Out of scope (deferred to later tooling increments)

- General autocomplete at every cursor position (substantial work). *(v0.17 adds a
  scoped completion for the adapter surface: consumable units after `consumes `,
  a unit's exported capabilities inside `consumes U { … }`, and in-scope
  capabilities after `given `. Broader completion remains deferred.)*
- Inlay hints (showing inferred types inline).
- Code lenses (e.g., "show service handlers" markers).
- Refactorings beyond rename (extract function, inline); non-quick-fix code-action kinds.
- Semantic tokens (type-aware highlighting beyond tree-sitter's syntactic level).
- Editor commands beyond what LSP standard provides (no "Bynk: Build" / "Bynk: Run tests" yet — those come later).
- Marketplace publication.
- Editor support beyond VS Code.
- Configuration formats other than `bynk.toml` (no `.yaml`, no `.json` for now).

## 2. Project model

### 2.1 Project discovery

A Bynk project is a directory containing `bynk.toml` at its root. The LSP discovers the project root by walking upward from any open `.bynk` file until it finds `bynk.toml`. If none is found before the filesystem root, the LSP treats the file as a single-file project (no workspace features) and shows a warning.

### 2.2 `bynk.toml` schema

```toml
[project]
name    = "my-bynk-project"     # required
version = "0.1.0"               # optional, free-form

[paths]
src = "src"                     # source root (default: "src")
out = "out"                     # compiled TypeScript output (default: "out")

[fmt]
indent             = "tab"      # "tab" (default) or "spaces"
indent_width       = 1          # number of tabs / spaces per level (default: 1 for tab, 2 for spaces)
max_line_width     = 100        # soft target for line wrapping (default: 100)
trailing_comma     = true       # trailing comma in multi-line lists (default: true)

[lsp]
diagnostics_mode   = "live"     # "live" (default) or "on_save"
diagnostics_debounce_ms = 300   # debounce delay for live mode (default: 300)
```

All fields are optional. A minimal `bynk.toml` is:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-bynk-project"
```

The LSP applies defaults for everything else. The file's *presence* is what marks the project root; its contents are advisory.

Future configuration alternatives (`.yaml`, `.json`) are not supported in this increment but the schema is designed to translate cleanly.

### 2.3 Workspace discovery

Once the project root is found, the LSP discovers all `.bynk` files under the configured `src` directory (recursive). These files form the project's source corpus. The LSP loads, parses, resolves, and type-checks them all on startup.

File watching is enabled for the `src` directory. Changes (file added, removed, modified externally) trigger re-discovery and re-resolution of affected files.

---

## 3. LSP capabilities

### 3.1 Syntax highlighting

Provided via a tree-sitter grammar (see `bynk-tree-sitter-spec.md`). The VS Code extension ships the compiled tree-sitter grammar. VS Code natively supports tree-sitter for syntax highlighting when configured.

The tree-sitter grammar covers all Bynk syntactic forms from v0 through v0.5. Highlighting groups follow standard tree-sitter conventions (`@keyword`, `@type`, `@function`, etc.) mapped to VS Code theme tokens.

### 3.2 Live diagnostics

The LSP server runs the existing Bynk compiler on the project's source corpus and reports errors and warnings as LSP diagnostics back to the editor.

**Behaviour (REVISED v0.24, ADR 0052 — project-wide):**
- With a project root (`bynk.toml`): every change triggers a **debounced
  whole-project analysis** via `bynkc::diagnose_project` — non-bailing
  (every file's diagnostics, not the first failure's), **overlay-aware**
  (open buffers layered over disk, so unsaved edits are diagnosed), and
  **file-attributed** (collection-point tagging; no `Span` change).
  Context files get full resolve/check diagnostics — the pre-v0.24 server
  resolved/checked `Commons` units only.
- Publish: **all-and-clear** — every file with diagnostics is published;
  every file that carried diagnostics last round and is now clean gets an
  **empty publish**. The publish/clear diff is a pure function
  (`bynk-lsp/src/publish.rs`), unit-tested without a transport.
- **Positions convert against the analysed snapshot** — `diagnose_project`
  returns the per-file text it analysed; spans never convert against a
  newer buffer (the analyse→publish window is real; debounce narrows but
  does not close it).
- Project-level diagnostics with no single owning file (group/cycle/
  directory validations) surface on `bynk.toml` at position 0:0.
- Single-file mode (no `bynk.toml`): the per-buffer `diagnose` path,
  unchanged.
- Debounce: 200ms, generation-counter based (a typing burst produces one
  analysis). Incremental/salsa-style recompute is deferred — full
  re-analysis is acceptable at current scale.
- Reported back via `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.

**Severity levels:**
- *Error* — compile errors that prevent valid output (type errors, unresolved references, etc.).
- *Warning* — compile warnings (unused capabilities in `given`, orphan doc blocks, etc.).
- *Hint* — suggestions (not currently used; reserved for future).

**Error recovery:** The LSP shows *all* errors in a file, not just the first one. This requires the parser and checker to recover and continue after errors rather than bail. If the existing compiler doesn't do this fully, extending it is part of this increment.

**Diagnostics include:**
- Primary message (the error description).
- Primary range (the source span).
- Secondary ranges where helpful (e.g., the conflicting declaration, the type mismatch source).
- Error category code (e.g., `bynk.types.if_branch_mismatch`) included in the diagnostic for filterability.

**Configuration:** Users can set `[lsp].diagnostics_mode = "on_save"` to disable live diagnostics. In on-save mode, diagnostics run only when the file is saved.

### 3.3 Hover

On cursor hover over a name, the LSP returns information via `textDocument/hover`. Specifically:

**On a type name:**
- The type's declaration (the source form, formatted).
- Any attached doc block.
- For exported context types: the visibility (`opaque` or `transparent`).
- For opaque types: a note that the representation is hidden.

```
type Money = { minorUnits: Int where NonNegative, currency: CurrencyCode }

---
The Money type represents an amount in a specific currency...
---
```

**On a function or method name:**
- The full signature.
- The doc block.
- For methods: whether instance or static.
- For service handlers: the `given` clause.

**On a variable / `let` binding:**
- The inferred or declared type.

**On a field access:**
- The field's declared type, plus any inline refinement.

**On a capability name:**
- The capability's declaration with all operations.
- The doc block.
- The available providers in the current context.

**On a keyword:** nothing (hovers only fire on identifiers).

Hover content is rendered as Markdown by the editor. The LSP returns `MarkupContent` with `MarkupKind.Markdown`.

**Markdown layout.** Hover content follows a consistent structure:

1. A fenced code block (```` ```bynk ```` ) containing the declaration's source form (formatted via the canonical formatter so it matches the project's style).
2. A blank line.
3. The attached doc-block content (if any), as plain Markdown.
4. For types with additional metadata (exported visibility, opaque representation note, etc.), a short list below the doc content.

Example for a `Money` record type:

````markdown
```bynk
type Money = {
  minorUnits: Int where NonNegative,
  currency:   CurrencyCode,
}
```

The Money type represents an amount in a specific currency. The minorUnits
field is the smallest indivisible unit of the currency.

— exported transparently from `commerce.payment`
````

Hover content stays compact — typically under twenty lines. For declarations that are long (e.g., a capability with many operations), the full declaration is rendered; the editor's hover popup handles overflow with scrolling.

### 3.4 Go-to-definition

`textDocument/definition` returns the location of a name's declaration.

**Resolution:**
- Type names → the `type` declaration.
- Function names → the `fn` declaration.
- Method names (`value.method()`) → the method's `fn TypeName.method` declaration.
- Field names (`record.field`) → the field's declaration in the record type.
- Variant names (`Pending`, `Ok`, etc.) → the variant's declaration in the sum type.
- Capability names → the `capability` declaration.
- Service operation names → the service's `on call` handler (the `on` keyword's location).
- Agent names → the `agent` declaration.

**Cross-file (required).** Definitions in other files within the same project must be resolved. The returned location points to the correct file and source range. This is a hard requirement — the language explicitly supports multi-file commons (v0.3) and context consumes graphs (v0.4); navigation that doesn't cross file boundaries is unusable for any non-trivial project. The LSP's project module (which loads all `.bynk` files at startup) already has the symbol tables needed; the definition lookup walks those tables, not just the open file's local tables.

**Binding-correct via the index (v0.25, ADR 0053).** Definition (and hover) resolve through the project **binding index** first — the use→def edges recorded at the compiler's own resolution sites — so duplicate names in different units navigate to the *bound* declaration, not the first name match. The legacy name-matching walk remains only as a fallback for the few kinds the index still defers (match-arm / `is`-narrowing bindings).

**Local bindings (v0.31, ADR 0064).** A `let`/`let <-` binding or a fn/handler/lambda parameter resolves to its declaration via the per-file **locals** (recorded with scope ranges), tried after the index and **before** the name-matching fallback — so a local navigates to its scope-correct binding, not the first textual match of the name. Match-arm and `is`-narrowing bindings are deferred.

**Imported names:** When a context uses a commons, names from the commons resolve back to the commons declaration (not to the context's rebranded copy — the original source location is more useful).

### 3.5 Formatter

The Bynk formatter applies canonical style to source files.

**Style rules (the defaults; all configurable via `bynk.toml`):**

- **Indentation:** tabs by default. One tab per nesting level. (This is for accessibility — users set their preferred tab width in VS Code; tab-based indentation respects that, space-based indentation does not.)
- **Brace style:** K&R / same-line. `if cond {` on one line, not `if cond` then `{` on the next.
- **Trailing commas:** present in multi-line records, sums, parameter lists, argument lists.
- **Blank lines:** one blank line between top-level declarations (types, functions, services, agents, capabilities, providers). No blank lines between fields within a record or arms within a match.
- **Doc blocks:** immediately above the declaration they document, no blank line between. Doc content has the common indent stripped (per v0.3's clarification).
- **Spacing:** one space around binary operators (`a + b`, not `a+b`); one space after commas; no space inside parens.
- **Line width:** soft target of 100 columns; the formatter wraps long lines where natural (after commas in long parameter lists, at `&&`/`||` boundaries in long expressions). For lists with delimiters (parameter lists, argument lists, record fields, exports clauses), the formatter emits single-line form when it fits within the line width and multi-line form otherwise. Multi-line form uses trailing commas; single-line form does not.

**Idempotency:** Running the formatter twice produces the same result. This is a requirement.

**Preservation:**
- Comments preserve their position relative to surrounding code.
- Doc blocks preserve their content verbatim (only the indentation is normalised).
- The semantic meaning of the code is preserved (same AST after parse → format → re-parse).

**Comment-preservation implementation requirement.** The formatter must not drop line comments (`-- ...`). This is a hard requirement — dropping user comments is data loss, which destroys trust in format-on-save and ultimately in the canonical-style discipline. Implementing this requires the lexer to emit comments as trivia tokens (or similar) so that the parser/formatter can track their positions and emit them in the formatted output. A side-pass scan of original source is acceptable as a fallback but trivia-tracking is the principled approach.

Specifically:
- Comments before a top-level declaration go above the declaration in the formatted output (with the doc block, if any, between the comment and the declaration).
- Comments at the end of a line stay on that line (`expr  -- note`).
- Comments on their own line within a block preserve their position relative to surrounding statements.
- Multi-line groups of comments stay together.

Doc blocks (`---`) are separate from line comments and are already preserved via the AST.

**Integration:**

- **Format-on-save:** the LSP responds to `textDocument/formatting` requests. VS Code with `editor.formatOnSave: true` calls this on every save. The LSP returns the formatted document as a single text edit.
- **Range formatting:** `textDocument/rangeFormatting` formats a selected range. Useful for "format this function." Implemented best-effort — the formatter operates on whole declarations, so the returned range may be slightly wider than requested.
- **CLI:** `bynkc fmt [file...]` formats files in place. `bynkc fmt -` reads from stdin, writes to stdout.

### 3.6 Status-bar integration

The VS Code extension shows two status-bar items when a Bynk file is open:

- **Project name** — from `bynk.toml`'s `[project].name`. Clicking opens `bynk.toml`.
- **Compiler version** — the version of the bundled `bynkc` binary. Clicking does nothing (informational).

If `bynk.toml` is missing, the project-name slot shows "no project" (clicking suggests creating one).

The status bar items only appear when the active editor has a `.bynk` file open.

### 3.7 Document symbols

The LSP responds to `textDocument/documentSymbol` requests with a hierarchical outline of the file's declarations. This populates VS Code's "Outline" pane (in the explorer sidebar) and powers the "Go to Symbol in File" command (Cmd-Shift-O).

**Symbols and their kinds:**

The LSP maps Bynk declarations to LSP `SymbolKind` values:

- `commons` declaration → `Module` (top-level container).
- `context` declaration → `Module`.
- `type T = ...` → `Struct` (for records), `Enum` (for sums), `Class` (for opaque types), `TypeParameter` (for refined values).
- `fn name(...) -> T` (free function) → `Function`.
- `fn TypeName.method(...)` → `Method` (nested under the type).
- `capability X { ... }` → `Interface`, with operations as `Method` children.
- `provides X = Y { ... }` → `Object`, with operations as `Method` children.
- `service X { ... }` → `Class`, with handlers as `Method` children.
- `agent X { ... }` → `Class`, with the state block as `Property` children and handlers as `Method` children.
- Record fields → `Field` children of their type.
- Sum variants → `EnumMember` children of their type.

**Hierarchy:**

The top-level container (commons or context) is the root. All other declarations are children. Methods nest under their type; record fields nest under the record; variants nest under the sum.

For multi-file commons or contexts, each file has its own document symbol tree — the LSP returns symbols for the current file only. The outline view shows the contents of the current file.

**Ranges:**

Each symbol carries two ranges:
- `range` — the full extent of the declaration (from the `type`/`fn`/etc. keyword to the closing brace).
- `selectionRange` — the identifier itself (the name being declared).

Clicking a symbol in the outline jumps to the `selectionRange`. The `range` is used for highlighting and breadcrumb display.

**Documentation:**

If a declaration has an attached doc block, its content (truncated to one line if multi-line) appears as the symbol's detail. VS Code shows this alongside the symbol name in the outline.

### 3.8 References (v0.25)

`textDocument/references` returns every reference to the symbol under the cursor, project-wide, from the **binding index** (ADR 0053): the index is assembled from use→def edges recorded at the compiler's resolution sites during the project analysis pass — binding-correct by construction, never name-matched. Two same-named symbols in different units never conflate.

**Coverage.** Top-level named declarations: types, free `fn`s, capabilities, services, agents, providers. **Members (v0.36, ADR 0069)** — instance methods, record fields, and capability ops — are also indexed, each keyed by a compound name (`"Type.method"`, `"Type.field"`, `"Cap.op"`) and recorded already-spelled from the parent type/capability the checker resolved at the use site, then qualified through the same `uses`/`consumes` walk as a cross-file type reference (so a same-named member on two parents stays distinct: `Counter.bump` ≠ `Gauge.bump`). A method **call** (`x.m()`), a **field** in any form (read `r.field`, construction label `T { field: … }`, spread override), and a capability-**op** call (local or cross-context) are all reference sites — so rename and references are complete. Reference sites include every way such a symbol is named — annotation and static-receiver type positions (`T.of`, `T.Variant`, `T { … }`, pattern qualifiers, `Mock[T]`), fn calls and first-class fn values, `given` clauses (bare, dotted `B.Cap`, flattened), capability op-call receivers, cross-context service calls, the clause lists (`exports opaque/transparent { T }`, `exports capability { Cap }`, `consumes U { Cap }` selections), and references from **test and integration units** (including a test body's `svc.call(…)`). Spans cover the **name segment only** — in `shop.billing.Pay` the reference is `Pay`; in `Counter.bump` the method site is `bump`.

**Local bindings (v0.31, ADR 0064).** `let`/`let <-` bindings and fn/handler/lambda params are **not** in the cross-file index (they are file-local); references for them come from the per-file **locals** instead — the definition plus every use that resolves to it within the binding's scope, recovered by a pure lexer scan over the snapshot (shadowing-safe). References/definition/highlight fall back to this when the index has no symbol at the cursor.

**Deferred kinds** (no entries yet): match-arm / `is`-narrowing bindings, generic type parameters (methods, record fields, and capability ops are now indexed — see above). First-party `bynk.*` units are excluded — they are not user-editable.

Positions convert against the **analysed snapshot** (§3.2's rule); `includeDeclaration` is honoured (the definition site is first). Requests outside a project (no `bynk.toml`) return no results.

### 3.9 Rename (v0.25)

`textDocument/rename` renames a symbol project-wide; `textDocument/prepareRename` (declared via `prepareProvider: true`) validates the position first and **refuses** (returns null) on anything the index does not cover — locals and unit/context names (renaming a unit implies a file move; that is the A-3 file-operations increment). Member rename (v0.36): renaming a method, field, or op edits the member segment of the compound key (`"Type.method"`, `"Type.field"`, `"Cap.op"`), never the parent prefix.

**Plan.** The edit set is exactly the index's sites for the symbol — definition plus every reference, name segments only — built against a **fresh analysis** of the current buffers. The new name must lex as a single identifier (keywords refuse).

**Validation — two checks, both correct-by-construction (ADR 0053):**

1. **Collisions by re-analysis.** The candidate edits are applied to an in-memory overlay and the project is re-analysed; any **new** diagnostic (per file + category) refuses the rename. This catches every collision class — same-unit name clash, `uses` import conflicts, flattened-capability clashes — without enumerating them.
2. **Capture/escape by index equality.** Re-analysis alone misses *silent re-binding* (a rename can make an existing name resolve somewhere new with no diagnostic — declared fns shadow fn-typed locals in call position). The re-built index must equal the pre-rename index **modulo the rename**: the renamed symbol's sites are exactly the edited ones, every other symbol's reference set is unchanged (after remapping the edit deltas). Any difference refuses.

A refused rename surfaces as an LSP request error with the reason — never a partial edit, and never a `bynk.*` diagnostic.

**Versioned edits.** The `WorkspaceEdit` uses `documentChanges` with `TextDocumentEdit`s carrying the document **versions captured when the analysed snapshots were taken** (disk-only files carry none). A buffer that drifted past its analysed version makes the client reject the rename rather than mis-apply it.

### 3.10 Code actions (v0.26)

`textDocument/codeAction` offers **quick-fixes** (`CodeActionKind.QuickFix`, the only kind advertised) computed from the **structured suggestions** riding on the diagnostics (ADR 0054): `bynkc` attaches machine-applicable `Suggestion`s — message, span→replacement edits, an `Applicability` — at the diagnosis site, the only place the exact spans and replacement are known. The LSP never re-derives a fix from a diagnostic's category or message.

**Keying.** A diagnostic's suggestions are offered when the requested range intersects the **diagnostic's span** — never the edits' spans, which can land far from the squiggle (both `given` fixes do: the diagnostic sits on the usage site or the return type; the edit lands in the clause).

**Serving.** Actions are computed from the **cached analysis round** (the same retained snapshots/versions that back references and rename, extended to retain the round's per-file diagnostics), never a fresh analysis — a fresh run is slow and can disagree with the squiggles the client is showing. A request arriving **before the first analysis round**, or for a file **outside the project**, returns the empty list. The request range converts against the analysed snapshot (§3.2's rule); each action's `WorkspaceEdit` is a **versioned** `TextDocumentEdit` against the analysed document version, so a drifted buffer rejects the edit rather than mis-applying it.

**Applicability.** Only `MachineApplicable` suggestions surface as quick-fixes; `HasPlaceholders` exists for a future CLI `--fix` and is never offered as a one-click edit.

**Available fixes.** The seed quick-fixes (ADR 0054) are the `given`-clause ones — add an undeclared capability, remove an unused one. v0.40 (ADR 0073) adds the **`InRange`-swap**: an inverted `InRange(hi, lo)` refinement bound (`bynk.types.inverted_range`) offers a two-edit fix that swaps the bounds in place (ints and floats; float lexemes preserved), backed by per-bound source spans recorded in the AST.

**The seed catalogue (v0.26):** remove an unused capability from the `given` clause (`bynk.given.unused_capability`) and add an undeclared one (`bynk.given.undeclared_capability`, bare and cross-context `B.Cap` — the cross-context entry inserts the canonical context path). Both edits are **list-aware**, authored in the checker: removal takes one adjacent comma and surrounding space with it, removing the *only* capability deletes the `given` keyword too, and adding inserts `, Cap` after the last entry or synthesises ` given Cap` after the handler's return type when the clause is absent. The result never double-commas, leading-commas, or leaves a dangling `given`.

### 3.11 Workspace symbols (v0.26 rider)

`workspace/symbol` enumerates the binding index's **definitions** (ADR 0055) — the same coverage as §3.8: types, free fns, capabilities, services, agents, providers. The query is a case-insensitive substring match on the symbol name (an empty query lists all), results ordered by (name, unit) with the owning unit as the container name. Positions convert against the analysed snapshot.

### 3.12 Document highlights (v0.26 rider)

`textDocument/documentHighlight` returns the symbol-at-cursor's occurrences **within the active file** — the §3.8 references query, file-scoped, definition included (ADR 0055). The index does not distinguish read from write references, so highlight `kind` is omitted. **Local bindings** (v0.31) highlight via the same per-file locals resolver as references. Requests on still-uncovered kinds (methods, fields, op names) return no highlights.

### 3.13 Inlay hints (v0.27; v0.39, ADR 0072)

`textDocument/inlayHint` returns hints for the request's visible range, of two anchor flavours driven by a `HintKind` discriminator on the harvested set:

**Inferred-type hints** (v0.27, `HintKind::Type`) — `let` and `let <-` bindings and lambda parameters whose annotation is **absent** (an explicit annotation needs no hint; `_` binds nothing and gets none). Each anchors at the **end of the binding name**, label `: T` with `T` in Bynk surface syntax via the checker's display rendering (`List[Int]`, `Option[String]`, `Int -> Int`); a `let <-` hint shows the **peeled `Effect[T]` payload**. `kind` is `Type`, no padding — the separator is part of the label, so it reads as source syntax (`x: Int`). *(The proposal sketched padding-left; implementation drops it.)*

**Parameter-name hints** (v0.39, `HintKind::Parameter`) — at a call argument, the callee's parameter name before the argument: anchored at the argument span's **start**, label `name:`, `kind` `Parameter`, `padding_right` (renders `count: 5`). Recorded by the checker at the free-fn, generic, method, and cross-context op/service argument loops. **Suppressed** when the hint would be noise — the `_`/`self` placeholders, or an argument that **is the identically-named identifier** (`f(count)` for parameter `count`); literals and complex expressions always get it. Local capability-op dispatch stores parameters type-only (no names) and gets none.

**Generic-instantiation hints** (v0.39, `HintKind::Type`) — at a generic call the user wrote *without* type arguments, the **inferred** ones after the function name: `identity`⟨`[Int]`⟩`(5)`. Recorded at the end of `check_generic_call` from the ground substitution, in type-parameter declaration order, anchored at the function-name span (a `Type`-kind hint, label `[A, B]`). Shown only when the call omitted the arguments (an explicit `identity[Int](5)` gets none) and every type variable resolved.

**Harvesting (ADR 0056).** Hints are a curated per-file set recorded by the **checker** at each binding site as it computes the binding's final type — never a tool-side re-inference, and not the raw typed model (which cannot position a hint). The sink is a `&mut` parameter (the `RefSink` shape), so recorded hints **survive a transient type error** at every site the checker still reaches; a fn-body error short-circuits that file's v0.5 declaration pass, so its **handler-body** hints are suppressed until the error clears. Synthetic and test/integration files record nothing.

**Serving.** Hints are served from the **cached analysis round** only, like code actions (§3.10): a request before the first round, or for a file outside the project, returns the empty list — as does a file whose group's composition failed (no analysed model). The visible range and the hint positions convert against the analysed snapshot (§3.2's rule). The server always produces hints; visibility is the client's (the editor's built-in inlay toggle; a `bynk.inlayHints.enable` extension setting is a B-1 surface item). `inlayHint/resolve` is not declared — labels are computed eagerly.

### 3.14 Semantic tokens (v0.28)

`textDocument/semanticTokens/full` (and `…/range`) returns resolution-aware tokens for the **index kinds** — the classification tree-sitter / the extension's TextMate grammar *can't* make (is this `Foo` a type, a capability, or a value?). Tokens are **additive over the client's syntactic layer**: keywords, literals, comments, and the uncovered identifiers (locals, params, generic type parameters — not in the index) keep their syntactic colour.

**The legend (frozen — ADR 0057).** The legend's array order **is the wire encoding**; entries are append-only and never reordered (a stability test pins both arrays):

| | |
|---|---|
| **Token types** | `type`, `function`, `capability`, `service`, `agent`, `provider`, `variable` |
| **Token modifiers** | `declaration`, `refined`, `opaque`, `platformNative` |

`type`/`function`/`variable` are the standard LSP types; the other four are **custom** (theme defaults ship with the extension — a B-1 item; unthemed clients fall back to the syntactic colour). `declaration` marks a `def` site (references carry none); `refined` requires a refinement **present** (`type X = Int` is a plain alias and carries neither `refined` nor `opaque`); `opaque` is orthogonal, so `opaque B where …` carries both; `platformNative` marks symbols declared by a platform unit (e.g. `bynk.cloudflare`'s `Kv`).

**Local bindings (v0.31.1, ADR 0064).** `let`/`let <-` bindings and fn/handler/lambda params (and their uses) carry the standard **`variable`** token — appended to the frozen legend at index 6, so existing indices are unchanged and VS Code themes it without an extension declaration (the legend-drift test adds `variable` to its standard-types allowlist). The producer merges local occurrences (the def carries `declaration`) into the same sorted stream as the index symbols — disjoint, since locals are never top-level. Occurrences come from the same per-file scope-resolved lexer scan as references (§3.8). A `parameter`-vs-`variable` split and match-arm/`is` bindings are later refinements.

**Sources (ADR 0057).** A pure `index_queries` producer reads **two** sources from the cached round: `ProjectIndex.symbols` (user-defined defs + refs) and **`ProjectIndex.foreign_refs`** — references to first-party (`bynk.*`) symbols, which `symbols` deliberately drops (synthetic defs point at files not on disk; definition/rename/workspace-symbol must never surface them). The side table is tokens-only; the v0.25 navigation invariants on `symbols` are untouched. `test`/`integration` files' references are in the index, so semantic tokens light up test files too.

**Serving & encoding.** Tokens are served from the **cached analysis round** only (no cached round / non-project file → empty); positions and the `range` request convert against the analysed snapshot (§3.2's rule). The token array is delta-encoded per the protocol — relative line/char, position-sorted (name segments never overlap), lengths in UTF-16 code units. The **`delta`** request variant is not declared (a later optimisation).

**Client theming (v0.29, ADR 0058).** The custom token types (`capability`/`service`/`agent`/`provider`) and modifiers (`refined`/`opaque`/`platformNative`) render with **no colour** under default themes unless the *client* declares them. The VS Code extension therefore declares them in `contributes.semanticTokenTypes` / `semanticTokenModifiers` (each custom type with a standard `superType` — `interface`/`type`/`class`/`function` — so semantic-highlighting themes colour it) and maps fallback TextMate scopes in `contributes.semanticTokenScopes` for theme without semantic rules. The declared **names are a cross-component contract** with the server's frozen legend — they must match exactly, or those tokens silently go unthemed — enforced by a `bynk-lsp` test that parses the extension's `package.json` against `semantic_tokens_legend()` (the single source of truth). Token *visibility* is the client's: the built-in `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled`, with no Bynk-specific toggle.

### 3.15 Completion (v0.17; positional in v0.30)

`textDocument/completion` returns context-keyed candidates. **Context detection is lexical** — it keys off the line up to the cursor, not the parse tree, because completion fires mid-edit when the buffer rarely parses; **candidates are semantic** (drawn from parsing the *other* project files with recovery, plus the static `bynkc` registries). The `completion::complete(line_prefix, doc_text, src_root)` producer is a pure function, fully unit-tested; the handler builds `line_prefix` and maps `CompletionKind` → `CompletionItemKind`.

**Lazy docs (`completionItem/resolve`, slice 5).** The list carries a one-line `detail` (the signature) eagerly; the richer **`documentation`** (markdown — doc comment + full rendering) is filled in only when an item is *focused*, via `completionItem/resolve`, so the initial list stays cheap. Each item stashes its document URI in `data` (a resolve request carries only the item, not a position); `completion_resolve` looks the symbol up by `label` through the **same hover renderer** (`symbols::describe_symbol`, local file → project-wide §3.4 → the embedded first-party sources). It is a no-op for an item that names no declared symbol (a keyword, kernel method, or local), whose `detail` already suffices. **First-party docs (slice 9):** hover and this resolver share a `describe_firstparty_symbol` fallback that scans the embedded `bynk`/`bynk.cloudflare`/`bynk.list`/`bynk.map`/`bynk.string` sources — so stdlib combinators and the `bynk` surface (which `walk_bynk_files` never sees) surface their signature, and any `---` doc block once the sources carry one. Auto-import via resolve is deferred. The detail strings themselves are **typed signatures** (params + return, via `type_ref_str`) for capability operations as well as free functions, matching hover and signature help.

The recognised contexts and their candidate sources:

| Context (lexical trigger) | Candidates | Item kind |
|---|---|---|
| `consumes <prefix>` (v0.17) | consumable units (contexts/adapters + `bynk`) | `MODULE` |
| `consumes U { … ` (v0.17) | the capabilities `U` exports | `INTERFACE` |
| `given … ` (v0.17) | in-scope capabilities (local, flattened, `U.Cap`) | `INTERFACE` |
| **type position** (`: T`, `-> T`, `[ … ]` type args) (v0.30) | built-in types + `bynk`-surface transparent types + project `type` decls | `STRUCT` |
| **keyword position** (a bare word at a decl/statement start) (v0.30) | reserved keywords (with registry docs) + declaration snippets | `KEYWORD` / `SNIPPET` |
| **name-receiver member** (`UpperIdent.`) (v0.30.1; built-in sums + full statics in slice 1) | sum-type variants (project + built-in `HttpResult`/`QueueResult`); refined/opaque `of`/`unsafe`; capability ops; built-in type statics (`Int.parse`/`Float.parse`, `Json.encode`/`decode`, `List.empty`/`Map.empty`, `Effect.pure`) | `ENUM_MEMBER` / `METHOD` |
| **value-receiver member** (`lowercase.`) (v0.30.2) | the receiver type's kernel methods (`xs.fold`/`s.split`/`o.map`) + record fields | `METHOD` / `FIELD` |
| **expression position** (after `=`/`(`/`,`/`=>`/an operator) (slice 2; free fns in slice 3) | the value constructors (`Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None`/`true`/`false`) + in-scope type names (static receiver / record construction) + in-scope free functions (the current unit's own `fn`s + `uses`-imported stdlib/project combinators) | `CONSTRUCTOR` / `STRUCT` / `FUNCTION` |
| **locals** (keyword / expression position) (v0.31.2) | in-scope `let`/param bindings (with inferred type) | `VARIABLE` |

**Surface contract (ADR 0093).** The table above is the *as-built* state; the
**canonical** surface — the full *cursor context × candidate-kind* matrix every
slice implements against — is fixed by ADR 0093. Three properties are normative:
**(a) completeness** — every populated cell offers *everything* its source
registry holds (`bynkc::{keywords, builtin_names, kernel_methods, firstparty}` +
the AST sum-variant tables), enforced by a registry-driven coverage test so a new
base type / keyword / kernel method / static / stdlib function must surface in
completion or CI fails; **(b) the ceiling boundary** — only the value-receiver
cell (and a local's inferred-type *detail*) may depend on the analysis overlay;
every other cell is registry/project-parse and offers candidates even in a broken
buffer. (Since slice 4 even that cell is best-effort, not all-or-nothing — ADR
0094.) **(c) `.` is a trigger character** so the member cells auto-fire. **Slice
1 closed the registry-sourced gaps** (per the ADR 0093 surface contract) — the `.`
trigger (G1), the statics table's missing `List.empty`/`Map.empty`/`Effect.pure`
(G2), and the built-in `HttpResult`/`QueueResult` variants (G3) — and added the
coverage test (the table above reflects them). **Slice 2 closed G4** — expression
position now offers the value constructors and in-scope type names (the
`complete()` arm), with locals/params still appended handler-side. **Slice 3
closed G5** — expression position also offers in-scope free functions: the current
unit's own `fn`s and the combinators of every `uses`-imported module (project +
the embedded `bynk.list`/`bynk.map`/`bynk.string` stdlib), gated on the `uses`
set. (The stdlib sources joined `for_each_unit`, so signature help resolves their
labels too.) **Slice 4 closed G6** — the value-receiver clean-file ceiling: Analyse
mode records best-effort partial `expr_types` (ADR 0094), so value-member
completion and signature help survive an unrelated type error elsewhere in the
file (the receiver types whenever it itself checks). The completion arc is
complete; only the upstream resolve gate (an unresolved name elsewhere) remains a
known limitation.

**Built-ins/surface come from static registries, not the index (ADR 0061).** Because first-party symbols aren't indexed (§3.14's finding), the built-in types (`Int`/`Bool`/`Float`/`String`/`Option`/`Result`/`Effect`/`List`/`Map`), keyword docs, the `bynk`-surface transparent types, and the built-in type statics (`Int.parse`/`Float.parse`/`Json.encode`/`decode`/`List.empty`/`Map.empty`/`Effect.pure`) are sourced from `bynkc::{keywords, builtin_names, firstparty}` (and a small static statics table; built-in sum variants come from the `bynkc::ast` `HTTP_VARIANTS`/`QUEUE_VARIANTS` registries) — the index (here, the project parse) supplies only *project* symbols. Keyword candidates are the lowercase-initial reserved words (declaration/statement keywords); uppercase type/value names belong to type/expression position. Snippets carry LSP `${n:…}` tab stops (`InsertTextFormat::SNIPPET`).

**Name-receiver members (v0.30.1, ADR 0062).** The `.`-member context is split by *what sits before the dot*. A **name** receiver — a single uppercase-initial identifier (`Color.`, `Email.`, `Clock.`) — is resolved from the project/surface parse to a sum/refined/opaque type or a capability, and its members are enumerated from the AST (no typed model, no scope query — the same mid-edit-safe recovery parse). A *plain* alias `type Id = Int` **does** carry `of`/`unsafe` (the emitter brands every `Refined` body), so they are offered; a **record** type has no name-receiver members (its fields are value-receiver).

**Value-receiver members (v0.30.2, ADR 0063).** A **value** receiver — a lowercase `x.` — needs the receiver's *type*, which the checker discards on the analyse path and which a bare mid-edit `x.` doesn't even parse. So the LSP **rewrites** the buffer to drop the trailing `.partial` (then `x` parses), **re-analyses** it, and types the receiver via the retained `expr_types` (`type_at_offset`). The type maps to its **kernel methods** — from the enumerable `bynkc::kernel_methods` registry (`List`→`fold`/`get`/…, `String`→`split`/…, `Option`/`Result`→`map`/`andThen`/…, `Int`/`Float`→`abs`/`round`/…), drift-pinned against the checker's dispatch — plus **record fields** from the AST. (`bynk.list`/`bynk.map` combinators like `map`/`filter` are *free functions* `map(xs, f)`, not members.) **Error-tolerant since slice 4 (ADR 0094):** the checker already types every well-typed sub-expression, then discarded the file's whole `expr_types` map on a final `errors.is_empty()` gate. Analyse mode now records that **best-effort partial map** at every per-file check exit (`check_record` *and* the context/declaration checks, where handler bodies are typed), so the receiver types whenever it *itself* type-checks — completion and signature help work mid-edit despite an unrelated *type* error elsewhere. Build stays Ok-only (codegen untouched). One ceiling remains: an unresolved name elsewhere bails before the checker runs (the resolve gate), so it still blanks the receiver.

**Conservative detection.** Type-position triggers exclude a list-literal `[` (its bracket isn't preceded by a type constructor); the one accepted false positive is a record *construction* value (`Order { id: ` — lexically identical to a record field-type declaration), where offering type names is mild noise. Name-receiver detection requires a *single* uppercase-initial segment, excluding the decimal `1.` and the `.`-qualified `a.B.`. Out-of-context prefixes (e.g. `let x = `) yield `[]`.

**Locals (v0.31.2, ADR 0064).** In-scope local bindings are offered at **keyword position** (appended to the keywords + snippets) and at **expression position** — after `=`/`(`/`,`, a `=>` lambda arrow, or a binary operator (the type arrow `->` excluded) — as `variable` items with their inferred type. They come from the **cached** analysis's `FileLocals` (the last good round's bindings around the cursor), so they survive the mid-edit buffer; positions convert against the cached snapshot. Locals are appended to a specific context's results only at keyword position — never to type/member completion.

**Later work.** The completion overhaul (the LSP tooling track's completion arc, against the ADR 0093 contract) is **complete**: the registry-sourced quick wins (G1–G3), the expression-position surface (G4), free-function/stdlib completion (G5), and the error-tolerant receiver typing that lifts the clean-file ceiling (G6, ADR 0094). Beyond the arc: the upstream resolve-gate ceiling (an unresolved name elsewhere still blanks the receiver), match-arm/`is`-narrowing local bindings, a `parameter`-vs-`variable` token split, `completionItem/resolve` (lazy docs / auto-import), and postfix expansion.

### 3.16 Signature help (v0.32)

`textDocument/signatureHelp` shows the callee's signature with the **active parameter** highlighted while the cursor is inside a call's argument list. **Context detection is lexical** (it must work mid-edit): scan back to the **innermost unclosed `(`** before the cursor (bracket-balanced — a depth-0 `[` or `{` means the cursor is in type args / a list / a block, not a call), take the **callee** identifier (`name` or `Recv.member`) immediately before it, and the **active parameter** from a top-level, bracket-aware comma count (so `f(g(x|))` targets `g`, and commas inside nested `()`/`[]` don't count). **Signatures are semantic**, resolved the same name-vs-value way as completion (§3.15):

| Callee | Source | Slice |
|---|---|---|
| free fn `bar(` | the `FnDecl` from the recovery parse | v0.32 |
| capability op `Clock.now(` | the `CapabilityOp` from the parse | v0.32 |
| refined/opaque `Email.of(` / `.unsafe(` | synthesised from the type's base | v0.32 |
| built-in static `Int.parse(`/`Json.decode(` | the `BUILTIN_STATICS` registry string | v0.32 |
| `Ok`/`Err`/`Some` constructor | built-in | v0.32 |
| value-receiver method `xs.fold(` | the receiver typed (§3.15's machinery) → the kernel-method registry signature | v0.32.1 (clean-file ceiling) |

Signatures render through the **same `type_ref_str` renderer as hover** (§3.3) — one format, never divergent; the kernel/static **registry signature strings are reused verbatim**. The response is a single `SignatureInformation` (Bynk has no overloads); `ParameterInformation` offsets parse the parenthesised parameter list (top-level-comma-aware). Trigger characters: `(` and `,`. The value-receiver path (v0.32.1) types the receiver by re-analysing the buffer rewritten so it parses (the `.method(args` dropped) — the shared `type_receiver` helper, with value-member completion's clean-file ceiling. Generic type-argument display in a signature waits on the checker recording instantiations queryably.

### 3.17 CodeLens (v0.33)

`textDocument/codeLens` returns one **reference-count lens** above each top-level **index definition** in the file — types, free fns, capabilities, services, agents, providers (the v0.25 index set; locals/methods/fields aren't indexed and get none). Served from the **cached analysis round**, positions against the analysed snapshot (§3.2's rule). The count is `refs.len()` from the binding index (a pure `code_lenses(index, path)` query returning `(def site, reference sites)`, sorted by definition position). The lens title is `"{n} reference(s)"` with the standard **`editor.action.showReferences`** command (args: the def URI, the def position, the reference `Location`s) — clicking peeks the references, no extension support required; non-VS-Code clients still render the title. **`"0 references"` is shown** (a dead-code signal). Computed eagerly (`resolve_provider: false`) — the count is `O(1)` off the index. The **test-run lens** ("▶ Run") needs test discovery + a run command and is deferred.

### 3.18 Call hierarchy (v0.34)

Call hierarchy is a three-call protocol served from the binding index's **call graph**. `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy` resolves the symbol under the cursor to a `CallHierarchyItem` (the goto-def resolution, anchored on the definition); `callHierarchy/incomingCalls` lists its callers, `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` what it calls — each with the call-site ranges.

The graph is a `CallEdge { caller, callee, site }` side table on `ProjectIndex`, built by **preserving `RefEdge.owner`** — the enclosing top-level declaration already recorded around each fn/service/agent/provider/capability body (`index.rs:73`) and, until now, used only for file re-attribution and then dropped. At assembly the owner resolves to the caller's `SymbolKey` through an `owner_keys` map populated in `add_def` alongside the existing `owner_files`, the same `(namespace, owner)` lookup the re-attribution uses. **Callees are `Fn` only** (method/op/dispatch callees aren't index symbols — deferred index kinds); **any indexed owner may be a caller** (so a service handler calling a free fn shows the service as a caller). Method owners (`"T.m"`) aren't index symbols, so they record no edge — visible as a callee whose reference count exceeds its incoming-call count. The call site (the callee-name span) is the `fromRanges` for both directions.

Pure `index_queries::{prepare_call_hierarchy, incoming_calls, outgoing_calls}` over `ProjectIndex.calls`, served from the **cached round**. The resolved `SymbolKey` round-trips through `CallHierarchyItem.data` (a `SerKey`, since the index kind isn't `Serialize`) so the follow-ups resolve straight off it; a missing/garbled payload returns no calls. Method/op/dispatch edges join the graph for free once the deferred index kinds land; **implementation navigation** (`given Cap` → provider) is §3.19.

### 3.19 Implementation navigation (v0.35)

`textDocument/implementation` on a **capability** symbol — its `capability Cap` declaration, a `given Cap` use, or a `provides Cap` use — returns the definition site(s) of every **provider** that implements it (the Bynk analogue of "go to implementations" on an interface). Served from the binding index's **implementation graph**: an `ImplEdge { capability, provider, site }` side table on `ProjectIndex`, built like the v0.34 call graph by resolving a reference's `owner` through `owner_keys`.

The edge comes from the `provides Cap = Provider` clause, which records a `Capability` reference whose owner is the provider. A provider may *also* declare `given Cap2` (its own deps) — also a capability ref owned by the same provider — so the owner alone can't tell "implements" from "depends on". The `provides` clause therefore records its ref with a **`provides` flag**; only flagged edges whose owner resolves to a `Provider` become `ImplEdge`s (the ref still counts as an ordinary capability reference). Cross-context `provides` links the capability's key in its defining unit to the provider's key in the providing unit, by construction.

`implementation` resolves the symbol at the cursor, requires it be a `Capability`, and returns the providers' def sites (a provider is an index symbol — the edge only names it), sorted by position; a non-capability symbol or a capability with no providers returns `None`. The **reverse** (provider → its capability) is already **goto-definition** on the `provides Cap` name and isn't re-plumbed. **External/adapter providers** are included — navigation lands on the Bynk `provides Cap = Name { external }` declaration, never the off-tree `.binding.ts`. Pure `index_queries::implementations(index, key)` over `ProjectIndex.impls`, served from the **cached round**.

**Go-to-type-definition (`textDocument/typeDefinition`, slice 6).** From a **value** at the cursor to the declaration of its (user-declared) type. The round's `expr_types` is now retained in the LSP `Analysis` (alongside the index/snapshots/locals); the handler reads the value's `Ty` at the offset (`type_at_offset`), unwraps a single-parameter container (`Option`/`Effect`/`List`/`HttpResult`) to its `Named` element, and returns that `Type` symbol's definition site(s). The lookup is a **bare-name match** (`Ty::Named.name` and the index both use bare names), so a type name shared across units yields several locations — the LSP-conventional resolution, the client lets the user choose. Built-in, function, actor, and two-parameter (`Result`/`Map`) types have no single type-declaration target and return `None`, as does a cursor not on a typed expression in a clean round. The **consumed-context** half (`uses B` / `B.Cap` → the context's source file) stays deferred — context units aren't index symbols, so it needs the unit→file map (also the basis for document links).

### 3.20 Folding & selection ranges (v0.37)

`textDocument/foldingRange` and `textDocument/selectionRange` are **structural** — served from the per-file **recovered AST** (the document-symbols parse path), not the binding index or the analysis round, so they answer even when the project doesn't check. One span visitor (`structure::collect`) walks the AST and yields every node's `(span, foldable)` pair; both providers consume it. AST-driven, consistent with the other structural providers — `bynk-lsp` carries no tree-sitter dependency.

**Folding** keeps the `foldable` (multi-line block-like) nodes: the `commons`/`context`/`adapter`/`test` container, type record/sum bodies, service/agent handler lists and their block bodies, provider/op and fn block bodies, `match` (and its arms), `if`, block expressions, and record/spread/list literals. A range is emitted only when `endLine > startLine` (LSP folds ≥2 lines); a decl and its body sharing both lines collapse to one. Structural ranges carry no `kind`. **Multi-line comment runs** fold as `FoldingRangeKind::Comment`, from a scan of the lexer's `Comment` tokens (the trivia table keeps only bodies, so spans come from the tokens) grouping consecutive comments on adjacent lines.

**Selection** filters the same node list to spans **containing** the cursor, de-duplicates, sorts by size, and links them into the `SelectionRange { range, parent }` chain — innermost first, widening to the whole file (a well-nested AST guarantees each parent contains its child). Falls back to an empty range at the cursor when nothing contains it or the file doesn't parse. Clause-list (`given`/`exports`/`consumes`) folding and per-statement folding within blocks are deferred.

### 3.21 Document links (slice 6b, ADR 0095)

`textDocument/documentLink` underlines each `uses`/`consumes` **unit name** and makes it clickable to that unit's source. It joins two pieces: the clickable **range** comes from parsing the *live buffer* (`symbols::unit_reference_spans` walks the recovered AST's `uses`/`consumes` declarations and returns each target's name span — so links track the document even mid-edit); the link **target** comes from the round's **unit→source map** (`unit_sources`), keyed by qualified unit name, resolving to the unit's first source file (a unit may span files). The map is **new analysis surface** (ADR 0095) — context/unit names aren't index symbols, the gap ADR 0068 flagged — built in one pass over the non-synthetic parsed units, available whenever the project structurally analyses (type errors included; empty only on a parse bail), and threaded `ProjectAnalysis` → `ProjectDiagnostics` → the LSP `Analysis`. A **first-party `uses`** (`bynk.list`, embedded via `include_str!`, no on-disk file) and an unresolved unit yield no link, by design — their *symbols* still surface through hover/completion (slice 9). **Go-to-definition on the same `uses`/`consumes` names** rides the same map: when the cursor sits on a unit-reference span and the index/locals paths don't resolve it, `goto_definition` returns the unit's first source file (at the top — units have no finer def site than their header). This closes the consumed-context half of §3.19's deferral for unit *declarations*; a unit-qualified capability reference (`B.Cap`) inside an expression is not yet a navigation source.

## 4. Implementation architecture

### 4.1 Component layout

The tooling project consists of four components:

```
bynk-tooling/
├── tree-sitter-bynk/        -- Tree-sitter grammar (separate sub-project)
│   ├── grammar.js
│   └── ...
├── bynk-lsp/                -- LSP server binary (Rust, in the compiler workspace)
│   ├── src/main.rs
│   ├── src/handlers/        -- LSP request handlers
│   └── ...
├── bynk-fmt/                -- Formatter (Rust, in the compiler workspace; used by both LSP and CLI)
│   └── src/lib.rs
└── vscode-bynk/             -- VS Code extension (TypeScript)
    ├── package.json
    ├── src/extension.ts
    └── ...
```

The tree-sitter grammar lives in its own repo / subdirectory because tree-sitter has its own build tooling (`tree-sitter generate`, `tree-sitter test`).

The LSP server and formatter live in the existing compiler workspace as new Rust crates. They depend on the compiler's existing modules (parser, resolver, checker).

The VS Code extension is a minimal TypeScript project that activates the LSP and ships the tree-sitter grammar.

### 4.2 Dependencies

**For `bynk-lsp`:**
- `tower-lsp` — LSP server framework for Rust. Handles protocol plumbing.
- `tokio` — async runtime (tower-lsp uses it).
- The existing compiler modules (in-tree dependency).

**For `bynk-fmt`:**
- The existing compiler's AST and parser (in-tree dependency).
- `std::fmt` for output rendering.

**For the tree-sitter grammar:**
- `tree-sitter-cli` (npm package; used for development and code generation).
- No runtime dependencies beyond tree-sitter itself.

**For the VS Code extension:**
- `vscode` (`@types/vscode`) — VS Code API.
- `vscode-languageclient` — LSP client for VS Code.
- `tree-sitter-bynk` (the compiled grammar).

### 4.3 LSP protocol surface

The LSP server declares support for these capabilities:

```
textDocument.synchronization: Full
textDocument.publishDiagnostics
textDocument.hover
textDocument.definition
textDocument.formatting
textDocument.rangeFormatting
textDocument.documentSymbol
textDocument.references            (v0.25, §3.8)
textDocument.rename                (v0.25, §3.9; prepareProvider: true)
textDocument.codeAction            (v0.26, §3.10; kinds: [quickfix])
textDocument.documentHighlight     (v0.26, §3.12)
textDocument.inlayHint             (v0.27, §3.13)
textDocument.semanticTokens        (v0.28, §3.14; full + range)
workspace.symbol                   (v0.26, §3.11)
workspace.workspaceFolders
workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles
```

(Completion was added in v0.17 for `consumes`/`given` surfaces.)

Not declared (out of scope so far):
- completionItem/resolve
- codeLens, inlayHint/resolve
- semanticTokens/delta
- signatureHelp

### 4.4 Error recovery for diagnostics

The LSP needs the parser and checker to recover and continue after errors so multiple errors can be reported. The existing compiler may currently bail at first error in each phase; extending it to recover is part of this increment.

**Parser recovery:** Skip to the next synchronisation point (closing brace, semicolon, top-level declaration keyword) and continue. Each recovered region produces a separate parse error but doesn't prevent parsing the rest.

**Resolver recovery:** Continue resolving even when individual names fail (mark them as unresolved in the AST). The checker then sees an annotated AST with both resolved and unresolved nodes.

**Checker recovery:** Continue type-checking even when individual expressions fail. Unresolved types propagate but don't cascade — once an unresolved type is encountered, further errors on the same expression are suppressed to reduce noise.

The result: a parse-resolve-check pipeline that produces a complete list of errors per file, not just the first.

### 4.5 Performance targets

- **Project load:** under 2 seconds for projects with ~100 source files. Larger projects are out of scope for performance optimisation in this increment.
- **Live diagnostics:** under 100ms for a single-file change (post-debounce). The 300ms debounce plus 100ms diagnostics = response within ~400ms after the user pauses typing.
- **Hover:** under 50ms for any hover query.
- **Go-to-definition:** under 100ms.
- **Format:** under 200ms for a 1000-line file.

These are targets, not requirements. If real-world performance falls short, the on-save fallback for diagnostics is the immediate mitigation; deeper optimisations (incremental compilation, persistent caches) come later.

---

## 5. The VS Code extension

### 5.1 Activation

The extension activates when:
- A workspace folder contains a `bynk.toml` file, OR
- A `.bynk` file is opened.

On activation:
1. Locate the `bynkc-lsp` binary (bundled with the extension or installed separately — for first cut, bundled).
2. Start the LSP server as a child process.
3. Connect via stdio.
4. Register file watchers on `**/*.bynk` and `bynk.toml`.
5. Register the tree-sitter grammar for `.bynk` files.
6. Show status-bar items.

### 5.2 Configuration

The extension reads VS Code settings under the `bynk.*` namespace:

```json
{
  "bynk.executablePath": "bynkc-lsp",    // path to the LSP server binary
  "bynk.trace.server": "off"             // "off" | "messages" | "verbose"
}
```

VS Code's built-in `editor.formatOnSave` is honoured for format-on-save behaviour.

### 5.3 Logging

LSP server logs to `~/.bynk-lsp.log` at warning level by default. The `bynk.trace.server` setting can crank this to verbose for debugging.

The extension exposes a "Bynk LSP" output channel in VS Code for protocol-level traces.

## 6. Testing strategy

### 6.1 Tree-sitter grammar tests

The tree-sitter project includes its own test infrastructure (`tree-sitter test`). Tests are organised by syntactic form:

- `corpus/v0.txt` — refined types, pure functions (v0 syntax).
- `corpus/v0.1.txt` — let, if/else, Result, etc.
- `corpus/v0.2.txt` — records, sums, methods, match, is, Option.
- `corpus/v0.3.txt` — opaque, multi-file, doc blocks, uses.
- `corpus/v0.4.txt` — contexts, exports, consumes.
- `corpus/v0.5.txt` — Effect, capabilities, providers, services, agents, commit.

Each test is an input source plus the expected parse tree. `tree-sitter test` verifies.

### 6.2 LSP tests

The LSP server has unit tests for individual handlers (hover, definition, formatting) using synthetic in-memory documents. End-to-end tests use the existing fixture corpus from the compiler — verifying that fixtures produce the expected diagnostics, hover content, and so on.

The v0.25 references/rename surface is tested as **pure functions** (`index_queries`): the `bynkc` fixture matrix proves the index captures every reference kind with name-segment spans and no same-name conflation, and the rename pipeline (plan → apply → re-analyse → validate) is exercised over real multi-file temp projects, including a collision refusal and a genuine capture refusal. The handlers are thin position/packaging shims over that core; the JSON-RPC round-trip harness remains deferred to the first feature that needs it.

The v0.26 code-action surface follows the same pattern: fix **correctness** is pinned in `bynkc` (each seed diagnostic carries its expected suggestion; the list-aware `given` fixtures assert exact text for first/middle/last/only positions, and every applied fix re-diagnoses clean), and the pure quick-fix computation (`code_actions`) is exercised end-to-end over a real temp project — diagnostic-span keying, the versioned `WorkspaceEdit`, and the applied-edit round-trip. The capability advertisement is a unit check over the extracted `server_capabilities()`; no transport round-trip is claimed. The riders are `index_queries` unit tests.

### 6.3 Formatter tests

The formatter is tested via snapshot tests using `insta` (same pattern as the existing compiler). For each input file, the expected formatted output is checked in. The formatter is run on the input; the result is diffed against the snapshot.

Idempotency tests: for each input, run the formatter twice and verify the output is identical between runs.

### 6.4 VS Code extension tests

Minimal — VS Code's testing infrastructure is verbose. For first cut, manual smoke tests:
- Open a fixture in VS Code with the extension installed.
- Verify highlighting appears.
- Verify diagnostics show.
- Verify hover works on a few identifiers.
- Verify go-to-definition works.
- Verify format-on-save works.

A more thorough test suite can come later if the extension grows complex.

## 7. Build and distribution

### 7.1 Building

The Rust components build via standard `cargo build --release` from the compiler workspace. Outputs:
- `target/release/bynkc` — the compiler CLI (already exists).
- `target/release/bynkc-lsp` — the LSP server.
- The formatter lives as a library used by both `bynkc` (for `bynkc fmt`) and `bynkc-lsp` (for the formatting capability).

The tree-sitter grammar builds via `tree-sitter generate` in the grammar directory. Output: `tree-sitter-bynk.so` (or `.dylib`/`.dll` per platform).

The VS Code extension builds via `npm run package` in its directory. Output: `bynk-vscode-<version>.vsix`.

### 7.2 Installation

For local sideload:

1. Build all three components.
2. Place `bynkc-lsp` in a location on `PATH` (or configure `bynk.executablePath` in VS Code).
3. Install the VS Code extension: `code --install-extension bynk-vscode-<version>.vsix`.

A bundled installer (single script or installer package) is not in scope for this increment; manual install is acceptable for first cut.

### 7.3 Updates

Updates are manual: rebuild, reinstall. Auto-update via a marketplace is deferred.

## 8. What's deferred (future tooling increments)

After this increment, the language has working tooling for the v0.5 surface. Future tooling work:

**Tooling v2 (probably after v0.6):**
- Autocomplete (the substantial missing feature).
- Semantic tokens (semantic highlighting).
- Editor commands ("Bynk: Build", "Bynk: Run tests").

Document symbols are shipped in v1.1 (§3.7) — they're cheap to implement
(AST walk) and unlock VS Code's outline view.

**Tooling v3:**
- Workspace symbol search.
- Refactorings (rename, extract).
- Inlay hints.
- Code actions / quick fixes.

**Tooling v4:**
- Marketplace publication.
- Auto-update infrastructure.
- Editor support beyond VS Code (Neovim, Helix, etc. — the tree-sitter grammar enables this; the LSP works in any LSP-capable editor; the question is which extensions to package and maintain).

These come as practice surfaces the need.
