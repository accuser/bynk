//! `bynk explain <code>` — the compiler's own explanation of a diagnostic code
//! (#853), the analogue of `rustc --explain`.
//!
//! Every `bynk.*` diagnostic carries a stable machine code, but a code alone is
//! a dead end for a newcomer. This subcommand prints the curated, *offline-
//! complete* explanation behind a code — what the rule is, why it exists, and a
//! minimal before/after example — plus a link to the relevant Book concept
//! page. The same [`bynk_syntax::diagnostics::EXPLANATIONS`] table backs the
//! editor's clickable diagnostic-code links (`codeDescription`), so the two
//! surfaces never drift (DECISION A).
//!
//! Coverage is incremental (DECISION B): a code with no curated explanation is
//! reported gracefully (its one-line registry summary, and a note that a longer
//! explanation is not written yet), and a code the compiler does not recognise
//! at all exits non-zero. Neither is an error state for the feature — a
//! half-covered set is a designed, documented condition.
