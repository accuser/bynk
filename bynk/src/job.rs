//! A Windows job object around each process tree `bynk dev` serves (#1762).
//!
//! On Windows, `bynk dev` cannot stop a `wrangler dev` by stopping the child it
//! spawned. Every way it resolves wrangler there (`npx.cmd`, or a `wrangler.cmd`
//! on `PATH` or in the project) is a `.cmd` shim, which runs under `cmd.exe /c`.
//! So the child is the `cmd.exe` wrapper, and the server is four processes
//! further down (`npx` → wrangler's `node` launcher → its CLI → two `workerd
//! serve`s). `TerminateProcess` on the wrapper does not touch its descendants,
//! and Windows has neither the process group nor the readable working directory
//! that the Unix `sweep` (#1742) finds stragglers by.
//!
//! A job object does not need to find them. A process assigned to a job stays in
//! it, and every process it creates afterwards joins it too, whether or not its
//! parent is still running. Terminating the job stops the whole tree, including
//! the `workerd`s a crashed wrangler has already orphaned, which is the shape
//! #1742 found on Unix. The job is created with
//! `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so closing the last handle to it also
//! stops the tree. That handle is `bynk dev`'s, so the tree is stopped when a
//! [`Job`] is dropped and when `bynk dev` itself exits, however it exits.
//!
//! The stop is a hard one. On Unix, `bynk dev` sends SIGTERM so that wrangler
//! can run its own teardown, because a SIGKILLed wrangler strands its `workerd`s.
//! Inside a job nothing is stranded, so there is no grace period to wait out.
//!
//! **The assignment race.** A job can only be assigned once the child exists, so
//! there is a moment after `spawn` in which the child runs outside the job. A
//! process it creates in that moment is not in the job. std gives no way to spawn
//! the child suspended and resume it afterwards, because it closes the child's
//! main-thread handle. `cmd.exe` takes milliseconds to start `npx`, and the
//! assignment follows `spawn` directly, so in practice the whole tree is caught.
//!
//! Windows only: the module is not compiled anywhere else.
