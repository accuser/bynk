//! Stopping `bynk dev` from outside (#1955).
//!
//! Without a handler, a SIGTERM or SIGINT sent to `bynk dev` alone (by a CI
//! step, a test harness, an editor task) killed it on the spot, and its
//! wranglers and their `workerd`s ran on with their ports bound. A Ctrl-C in a
//! terminal never showed it, because the terminal signals the whole foreground
//! group, wranglers included.
//!
//! [`install`] replaces the default action with one that only records the
//! signal. `bynk dev`'s watch loop sees it on its next tick and stops its
//! contexts the way it does when one of them exits: SIGTERM to each wrangler,
//! then the sweep of what they leave behind ([`crate::sweep`]). The wranglers
//! stay in `bynk dev`'s process group, because the sweep finds orphaned
//! `workerd`s by that group and a Ctrl-C must still reach them all.
//!
//! The handler is one-shot (`SA_RESETHAND`): a second Ctrl-C while the
//! contexts are stopping takes the default action and ends `bynk dev` at once.
//!
//! Unix only. On Windows each wrangler's job object holds its tree (#1762), and
//! [`install`] does nothing.
