title: Decode untrusted JSON into a typed value
---
**Goal:** turn a raw JSON string from outside the program into a fully-typed —
and validated — Bynk value, with a typed error when it does not fit.

`Json.decode[T](s)` parses a JSON string and checks it against `T`, returning a
`Result[T, JsonError]`. The check covers both **shape** (the right fields and
base types) and any **refinements** on `T`, so untrusted JSON only ever enters
your program as a value that already satisfies its type's invariants — the
"make illegal states unrepresentable" idea, applied at the boundary.

## Decode into a record

```bynk
commons orders {
  type Order = {
    id: String,
    qty: Int,
  }

  fn parse(raw: String) -> Result[Order, JsonError] {
    Json.decode[Order](raw)
  }
}
```

The type argument is required (`Json.decode[Order](raw)`) — it tells the
compiler what shape to validate against. A missing field, a wrong base type, or
malformed JSON all produce an `Err(jsonError)`; a well-formed payload produces
`Ok(order)`.

An `Option` field is the exception to "a missing field is an error". JSON that
Bynk didn't write usually leaves an optional field out, or sets it to `null`, or
gives the bare value, and `decode` accepts all three:

```bynk
commons registry {
  type Repo = {
    repo: String,
    description: Option[String],
  }

  fn parse(raw: String) -> Result[Repo, JsonError] {
    Json.decode[Repo](raw)
  }
}
```

`{"repo": "a"}` and `{"repo": "a", "description": null}` decode with
`description` set to `None`, and `{"repo": "a", "description": "d"}` decodes
with it set to `Some("d")`. Bynk's own tagged form, which `Json.encode` writes,
also works: `{"kind": "Some", "value": "d"}` and `{"kind": "None"}`, as long as
the object has no other keys. A tagged object with an extra key, such as
`{"kind": "Some", "value": "d", "note": "x"}`, is read as a bare value instead.
A bare value is still checked as the inner type, so `"description": 7` is an
error, and so is that extra-key object.
See [the JSON codec](/book/reference/types/#the-json-codec) for the full rule.

## Decode straight into a refined type

Point `decode` at a type whose fields are refined, and the predicates are
enforced as part of decoding — no separate `.of` step:

```bynk
commons orders {
  type OrderId = String where NonEmpty
  type Quantity = Int where InRange(1, 1000)

  type Order = {
    id: OrderId,
    qty: Quantity,
  }

  fn parse(raw: String) -> Result[Order, JsonError] {
    Json.decode[Order](raw)
  }
}
```

`{"id": "", "qty": 5000}` is rejected — the empty `id` violates `NonEmpty` and
`5000` is outside `Quantity`'s range — so a decoded `Order` is guaranteed valid
everywhere downstream.

## Handle the result

`JsonError` is an ordinary error type, so handle it like any other `Result` —
propagate with `?`, or branch with `match`:

```bynk
commons orders {
  type Order = { id: String, qty: Int }

  fn quantityOf(raw: String) -> Result[Int, JsonError] {
    let order = Json.decode[Order](raw)?
    Ok(order.qty)
  }
}
```

## Encode the other way

`Json.encode(v)` serialises a checked value to a JSON `String`:

```bynk
commons orders {
  type Order = { id: String, qty: Int }

  fn render(o: Order) -> String {
    Json.encode(o)
  }
}
```

input](/book/guides/type-system/define-and-validate/) (the `.of` path, for values you already have in
hand), and the [type-system reference](/book/reference/types/#the-json-codec).
