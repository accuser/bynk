//! Name resolution (spec §5.1, v0.1 §4.1, v0.2 §4.1).
//!
//! Builds symbol tables for the commons and validates that:
//! - No two top-level items share a name (types, fns, methods are all named).
//! - Every `TypeRef::Named` resolves to a declared type.
//! - Every free function call resolves to a function declaration.
//! - Every identifier in expression position resolves to a parameter, a
//!   `let` binding, or `self` (inside a method).
//! - Constructor / static calls (`TypeName.method(args)`) resolve either to
//!   the built-in `T.of` of a refined type, a static method on `T`, or a
//!   variant constructor when `T` is a sum type.
//! - Record construction targets a declared record type and uses only
//!   declared fields.
//! - Method calls resolve via the receiver's nominal type (the actual type
//!   check happens in the type checker).
//!
//! On success returns a [`ResolvedCommons`] — the original AST plus
//! symbol tables the type checker consumes.
