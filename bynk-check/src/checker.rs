/// T3.6b (R4.1): the intern table `TyId` is minted from. Owned per
/// `check_record` invocation (design settled in the identity-and-totality
/// track doc §9 before this slice started): created fresh at `check_record`'s
/// entry, threaded through `Ctx`, carried out on `TypedCommons`/`RecordCheck`
/// alongside `expr_types`, and forwarded across the `bynk-check`→`bynk-emit`
/// boundary on `CheckedProgram` (T3.7a/T3.7b already built that seam).
/// Confirmed safe by checking how cross-unit type references actually flow:
/// `compose_unit_symbols` merges `TypeDecl` (immutable AST declarations)
/// across units, never an already-interned `Ty`/`TyId` — every unit
/// re-interns its own `Ty` graph from shared declarations, so `TyId`s are
/// never compared across two different `check_record` invocations.
///
/// **Why [`intern`](Self::intern) takes `&self`, not `&mut self`.** The table
/// is reached from `Ctx`, whose other fields (`expr_types`, `errors`, the
/// sinks) are themselves `&mut` and are routinely live across an interning
/// call — `ctx.tys.intern(…)` inside a loop over `ctx.scopes` is the common
/// shape, not the exception. A `&mut Types` would make the borrow checker,
/// not the type system, the thing every one of the ~200 minting sites is
/// written around. Interior mutability keeps `&'a Types` `Copy`, so a
/// function that needs the table just reads `ctx.tys` once and is done.
///
/// **Why a `Mutex` and `Arc`, not a `RefCell` and `Rc`.** The compiler itself
/// is single-threaded, so a cell would do for `bynk-check` and `bynk-emit` —
/// but the table rides out on `TypedCommons`/`ProjectAnalysis` into
/// `bynk-lsp`, whose `tower-lsp` handlers are `async` and therefore require
/// `Send`. A non-atomic refcount is exactly what `Send` forbids, so the
/// choice is made by the consumer, not by the compiler's own threading. The

/// v0.177 (#643): two refinements match when their **canonical forms** are

///
/// This retires the v0.6 §4.3 foot-gun the status doc named: predicates were
/// compared by `zip`, so `String where NonEmpty, MaxLen(10)` and
/// `String where MaxLen(10), NonEmpty` — the same type — spuriously failed to
/// match. Predicates are conjunctive and side-effect-free, so their order
/// carries no meaning and comparing it was always accidental.
///
/// The comparison routes through `contract::canon_refinement`, the same function
/// that feeds the cross-context contract hash, and deliberately so: if the
/// matcher and the hash disagreed about what "the same refinement" is, a
/// contract could type-check at compile time and 409 at runtime — the worst
/// failure available to this increment. One normal form, two consumers.
///
/// The asymmetry is unchanged: a *more* restrictive sending side is admitted
/// into a more permissive receiving one, but not the reverse.
///
/// One behavioural consequence of sharing the form: it de-duplicates, so
/// `where NonEmpty, NonEmpty` now matches `where NonEmpty`. That is correct — a
/// conjunction is idempotent, so they are the same type — and it must hold on
/// the hash side regardless, or two contexts spelling the same type differently
/// would fail closed against each other.
