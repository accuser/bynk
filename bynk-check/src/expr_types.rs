//! v0.30.2 (ADR 0063): the expression-type sink.
//!
//! The checker computes `expr_types: HashMap<ExprId, TypedExpr>` per file as
//! it types each expression (T3.4, R2.4 — keyed by node identity, not
//! position). On the Ok path that map rides inside the `TypedCommons`; on the
//! error path inside `RecordCheck::typed_despite_errors`, the program as
//! checked so far.
//! This sink carries it out to the analysis so completion can ask *"what is
//! the type of the expression at this offset?"* (the receiver before a `.`),
//! mirroring [`HintSink`](crate::hints::HintSink).
//!
//! Capture is at **every per-file exit** of the check, clean or not (ADR 0094,
//! via [`record_analyse_types`](crate::check_pipeline::record_analyse_types)):
//! a mid-edit file with an error still yields the best-effort types of its
//! other expressions. ADR 0094 lifted the slice-3 "clean-file ceiling" of
//! ADR 0063, under which a file with errors yielded nothing.
//! Unlike hints, **test/integration files are not muted** (completion runs in
//! them); only synthetic toolchain-injected files are.
