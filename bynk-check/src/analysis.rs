//! The project-level analysis entry point (P4.1, #1115): discovery
//! (`bynk-project`) → parse → resolve → check, returning the `bynk-ide`-facing
//! analogue of `bynk-emit`'s `ProjectAnalysis` — without ever emitting.
//!
//! `bynk-ide` is repointed at [`analyse_project`] as of P4.2 (#1122) —
//! `bynk_emit::project::analyse_project_with` is no longer reachable from
//! `bynk-ide` at all (it has no `bynk-emit` dependency left). This entry
//! point is what every real caller uses today; the differential fixture
//! (`bynk-check/tests/differential_analysis.rs`) still pins it against
//! `analyse_project_with` directly (both remain real, exercised paths —
//! `bynk-emit`'s own CLI build still drives `run_checks`), so a future
//! divergence between the two is still caught even though only one of them
//! feeds the editor now.
//!
//! ## The residual gap
//!
//! This entry point was diagnostically faithful to `bynk-emit`'s
//! `run_checks`'s `Mode::Analyse` arm **minus seven categories** of
//! whole-project checking at P4.2 (recorded on the tracking issue's own
//! scope-correction comments, not silently assumed). Categories 2, 3, 4 and 6
//! closed at P5.0/P5.1/P5.2 (`design/tracks/semantics-in-the-checker.md` §6)
//! — [`crate::project_model::phase_messages_bundles`]/
//! [`crate::project_model::phase_locale_bundle_ambiguity`]/
//! [`crate::project_model::phase_event_subscriptions`]/
//! [`crate::project_model::phase_function_type_boundaries`] are now called
//! from [`analyse_project`] at the same points `run_checks` calls them.
//! Categories 1 and 5 closed at P5.3, structurally rather than observably —
//! both were already unreachable from the editor before P4.2 even shipped,
//! so porting them changed nothing observable. Category 7 closed at P5.4, the
//! last of the seven and the one this doc comment's own author flagged as
//! needing more care (§9 of the design doc) — see below. All seven
//! categories are now closed:
//!
//! 1. ~~Schema-registry reconciliation~~ — **closed at P5.3**.
//!    [`crate::schema_registry::reconcile`] is now called from
//!    [`analyse_project`], right after [`crate::project_model::phase_validate_providers`]
//!    (the same relative point `run_checks` calls it). Still unreachable on
//!    this path — it only ever fires under `SchemaLock::On`, and this entry
//!    point has no on-disk lock concept at all, so it always reconciles
//!    against an empty registry, which every event baselines against
//!    silently — so relocating it changed nothing observable; it now simply
//!    originates in `bynk-check`, per R3.5.
//! 2. ~~`messages` bundle validation~~ — **closed at P5.0**, see above.
//! 3. ~~Locale bundle ambiguity~~ — **closed at P5.0**, see above.
//! 4. ~~Event-subscription validation~~ — **closed at P5.1**, see above.
//! 5. ~~Platform-lock enforcement~~ — **closed at P5.3**.
//!    [`crate::project_model::phase_platform_lock`] is now called from
//!    [`analyse_project`], right after the per-unit compose/check loop (the
//!    same relative point `run_checks` calls it, gated the same way on a
//!    clean error sink so far). Still unreachable on this path, for the same
//!    reason as before the relocation: `analyse_project` hardcodes
//!    `Platform::default()` (Cloudflare) and `BuildTarget::Bundle`, and
//!    `bynk.cloudflare` is the only platform-native unit that exists
//!    (`firstparty::platform_of`) — so `lock_violation` can never find a
//!    native platform disagreeing with the selected one, for any project, on
//!    this path. No fixture can observe this category regressing (or
//!    improving) because it never fired through this path to begin with, both
//!    before and after this relocation.
//! 6. ~~Function-type-boundary checks~~ — **closed at P5.2**. Formerly reached,
//!    in `bynk-emit`, only through `phase_group`'s optional boundary-check
//!    hook (`Some` from `run_checks`, `None` here); the hook is gone —
//!    [`crate::project_model::phase_group`] now calls
//!    [`crate::project_model::phase_function_type_boundaries`] directly, at
//!    the exact point the hook used to fire, so both callers see it in the
//!    same diagnostic-ordering position as before.
//! 7. ~~Test/integration-suite processing~~
//!    (`process_tests`/`process_integration_tests`) — **closed at P5.4**.
//!    Unlike categories 2-6, these run *unconditionally* in `run_checks`, in
//!    `Mode::Analyse` too, and push into the same shared error sink (`bynk-emit`'s own
//!    `check_project_reports_a_test_body_error_past_an_earlier_structural_error`
//!    pins a `bynk.types.let_annotation_mismatch` originating inside a
//!    `suite`/`test integration` body). The two functions were emission-coupled
//!    (`CompiledFile`, `RunnableTest`, `ImportExt`, `contracts`, a shared
//!    `emitted_barrels` set) deeply enough that P5.4 split them at the
//!    check/emit boundary rather than porting the whole thing: their checking
//!    half relocated to [`crate::test_suites::phase_test_bodies`]/
//!    [`crate::test_suites::phase_integration_bodies`], now called from
//!    [`analyse_project`] right after the per-unit compose/check loop (the
//!    same relative point `run_checks` calls the originals, unconditionally —
//!    unlike categories 2-6, neither is gated on a clean error sink), while
//!    emission itself stays in `bynk-emit::project::tests_emit`, which now
//!    calls the relocated checking phase too rather than duplicating it. Both
//!    functions still take `&mut RefSink`, so every binding edge inside a
//!    `.bynk` suite file is populated here again too — go-to-definition
//!    inside a test file works through this entry point once more.
//!
//! Emission itself is orthogonal rather than a gap: this entry point never
//! emits, by construction (it has no `BuildTarget`/`ImportExt`/`contracts`
//! concept at all), so there is no diagnostic-agreement question to ask of it.
//!
//! A fixture that exercises none of the seven categories above sees identical
//! diagnostics from this entry point and from `analyse_project_with` — that
//! is what the differential fixture's two clean/broken cases assert. A third
//! case (`new_entry_point_omits_test_body_diagnostics`) pinned category 7's
//! divergence directly; now that P5.4 closed it, that test asserts parity
//! instead (see its own doc comment).
//!
//! ## Two sites outside the seven-category accounting
//!
//! `bynk-check/src/analysis.rs`'s own seven categories were `run_checks`'s
//! whole-project checks; two more registered diagnostics were still
//! constructed in `bynk-emit` and outside that accounting, found and closed
//! at P5.5 (`design/tracks/semantics-in-the-checker.md` §6, §9):
//!
//! - `bynk.project.schema_registry_corrupt` — a malformed on-disk
//!   `bynk.schema.lock`. [`crate::schema_registry::parse_or_diagnose`] now
//!   constructs it. Unreachable from this entry point, same reason as
//!   category 1: no on-disk lock concept exists here.
//! - `bynk.secrets.computed_name` — see
//!   [`crate::project_model::phase_secrets_computed_name`]'s own doc. Unlike
//!   the seven categories (scoped and confirmed live gaps or confirmed
//!   gap-in-name-only by this settling pass), this one's reachability from
//!   *this* entry point was still open at settling time — §9 named it a risk
//!   rather than a scoped item. It resolved the same way categories 1 and 5
//!   did: gap-in-name-only, since `run_checks`'s own gate
//!   (`target == BuildTarget::Workers`) can never pass against this entry
//!   point's hardcoded `BuildTarget::Bundle`.
