//! v0.104 (real-time track slice 3b): shared analysis of a `from websocket`
//! `on open` handler for the Workers wire path.
//!
//! On Workers the upgrade is authenticated at the edge, then forwarded to the
//! **Durable Object that hosts the connection** — the agent the `on open`
//! transfers it to. For that routing to be static, the handler must transfer the
//! connection to exactly one agent, by a key derivable from the request (D2).
//! This module finds that single transfer; both the checker (to diagnose a bad
//! shape) and the emitter (to route the upgrade) use it.
//!
//! Lives in `bynk-check` (moved here in the compiler-pipeline-review's Wave
//! 5, batch 5.1) rather than `bynk-emit`: it depends only on `bynk-syntax`'s
//! AST and is conceptually checker-side analysis, misfiled under the emitter.
