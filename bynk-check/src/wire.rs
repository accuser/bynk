//! #855: the wire-contract IR — the shape a Bynk type takes crossing a
//! context boundary, derived once from the AST + type table so both the
//! emitter's codec generation and the editor's "wire contract" peek render
//! the *same* derivation instead of two hand-synchronised ones.
//!
//! **The seam:** *`bynk-check` says what the boundary is. `bynk-emit` says
//! how that reads as TypeScript.*
//!
//! Crossing this module boundary is legal for `BaseType`, `PredKind`,
//! `TypeRef`, `Expr`, `TypeDecl` (all `bynk-syntax`) — the vocabulary a
//! boundary type is built from. It is **not** legal for any TS-token string,
//! `pred_condition_and_message` (`bynk-emit/src/emitter.rs`, stays put),
//! `lower_field_default_wire` (`bynk-emit/src/emitter/serialisation.rs`,
//! stays put — a default's *wire literal* is a rendering, not a boundary
//! fact), or the `Qual` type-name→TS-namespace-prefix map (`bynk-emit`'s
//! `serialisation.rs`; see the [`Provenance`] doc for why it cannot move
//! here). `bynk-emit` renders this IR into TypeScript; it does not re-derive
//! it.
//!
//! **Derived from AST + type table, not `checker::Ty`.** `Ty::Named { name,
//! kind, args }` carries no refinement predicates, so a `Ty`-based
//! derivation would still need this same type-table lookup for `PredKind`s —
//! `Ty` would buy only generic substitution, which the moved walks below
//! already implement directly over `TypeRef`. `contract.rs` (this crate)
//! also derives straight from the AST + type table and must not depend on
//! checker output being available; this module keeps the same shape of
//! dependency.
//!
//! **This IR is *not* `contract.rs`'s canonical form**, and the two must
//! never be unified — they disagree on purpose, on every axis that matters:
//!
//! | | `contract.rs` (hash) | `wire.rs` (this module) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | predicates | sorted, deduped | **declaration order**, not deduped |
//! | record fields | sorted by name | declaration order (emitted key order) |
//! | sum variants | sorted by name | declaration order (`switch` arm order) |
//! | opaque predicate | **elided** — unobservable to the consumer | **present** — the owner still re-validates |
//!
//! `contract.rs:248` documents the sorting as a *precondition* for hash
//! correctness — hashing predicates in source order "would make two contexts
//! that agree perfectly fail closed against each other." The hash is a
//! **type identity** (order-insensitive by design); this module's shapes are
//! an **emission order** (order-sensitive by necessity, since a JS `switch`
//! and an inlined `if` chain both have a literal source order a reader can
//! see). Merging them would create the exact spurious-409 failure the hash
//! exists to prevent. What the two genuinely share — and what a cross-check
//! test elsewhere asserts — is *boundary-type reachability*, not shape.
