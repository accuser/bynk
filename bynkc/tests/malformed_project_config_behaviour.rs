//! Regression: `bynk.toml` is the one input a user hand-edits that the
//! compiler used to read without checking. The deleted `read_project_paths`
//! was total by construction — a syntax error or a typo'd `[paths]` key both
//! silently fell back to the conventional layout with no diagnostic and exit
//! 0, after which the user would only see a downstream cascade (e.g.
//! `bynk.uses.unknown_target` pointing at units that plainly exist on disk)
//! with no hint at the real cause. `try_read_project_paths` (R3.8, #1113)
//! surfaces both instead.
//!
//! Drives the real `bynkc check` CLI against the two malformed-config
//! fixtures and asserts each now fails loudly with an actionable message,
//! instead of silently succeeding — plus the R3.9 (#1113) counterpart: an
//! `include` list of three or more roots used to be capped at two
//! (`too_many_include_roots`, silently dropping the third tree); `Roots::trees`
//! now walks every entry, so the same shape of fixture must instead *succeed*
//! and discover all three trees.
