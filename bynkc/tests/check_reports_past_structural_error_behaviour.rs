//! Finding #64: `bynkc check`'s directory path used to route through
//! `compile_project`, whose `Mode::Build` bails at the first structural error
//! and returns only what it collected up to that point. Once any file in the
//! project had an earlier structural error (here, `exports capability`
//! naming an undeclared capability), every later diagnostic — including a
//! test body's own type error, which only surfaces in the per-unit checking
//! pass that runs *after* the bail gate — was silently dropped, even though
//! the editor (`analyse_project_with`, which already used `Mode::Analyse`)
//! still reported it. `bynkc check` now routes through `check_project`
//! (`Mode::Analyse`, never bails) instead, so both diagnostics are reported
//! and the exit code is decided by "does any error-severity diagnostic
//! exist," not "did the pipeline reach the end without bailing."
