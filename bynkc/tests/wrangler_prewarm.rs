//! Drift guard: every workflow that runs the suite with the workerd gate
//! required must pre-warm the npx cache for the exact spec the smokes run.
//!
//! Why this guard exists rather than a comment: the pre-warm step is the only
//! thing standing between the smokes and the concurrent-`npx`-install race
//! documented in `wrangler/mod.rs`, and its failure mode is silent. A spec bump
//! that updates the tests but not the workflows leaves a step that warms the
//! wrong package — the cache the tests want is still cold, they still race, and
//! the only symptom is an intermittent 180s timeout on a leg that used to be
//! green.
