The **resolved declaration-level vocabulary the [Bynk](https://github.com/accuser/bynk)
emitter reads**, instead of re-deriving the same facts from
`bynk_syntax::ast` a second time.

Every type here is a value some [`bynk-lower`](https://crates.io/crates/bynk-lower)
helper returns from a syntax-tree node plus the checker's own typed
program — a service's protocol, a handler's kind and route cache, a `type`
declaration's structure, an agent store field's storage shape, a capability
op's signature, a `given` capability reference, an actor's authentication
seam, an events subscription's pattern and shape, and the literal values a
pattern can carry. Alongside them: four AST-walk helpers shared between
`bynk-lower` and `bynk-emit` (`block_uses_emit`, `walk_block_exprs`,
`walk_exprs`, `match_needs_if_chain`).

**Not an expression-level IR.** An earlier version of this crate held a full
typed expression IR — `IrExpr`, pattern/match compilation, every declaration
variant of `IrItem` — built but never consumed by the emitter; it was deleted
once a full pricing showed finishing that cutover would mean a second code
generator, not a retype (`design/greenfield-status.md`'s `unconsumed_ir_items`
probe holds this at 0). What's left is the declaration-level facts
`bynk-emit` genuinely reads today.

## Where it sits

This crate depends on [`bynk-syntax`](https://crates.io/crates/bynk-syntax)
and [`bynk-check`](https://crates.io/crates/bynk-check) (for `TypedCommons`
and the resolver's own types). `bynk-lower` builds `bynk-ir` values from a
checked program; `bynk-emit` is the consumer both crates exist to serve.
Every `pub` item here is required to have a reader outside both `bynk-ir` and
`bynk-lower` — a gated CI probe fails the build otherwise.

## Use

```toml
[dependencies]
bynk-ir = "0.289"
```

`bynk-ir` values are constructed by `bynk-lower`'s own helpers, not built by
hand — see that crate's docs for the lowering entry points. This crate's own
surface is the value types and the shared AST-walk helpers.

See the [API docs](https://docs.rs/bynk-ir) for the full surface.
