//! through `bynk-lower`'s AST-analysis helpers, instead of re-deriving the
//! same facts from `bynk_syntax::ast` a second time.
//!
//! Every type here is a value some `bynk-lower` helper returns from a
//! syntax-tree node plus the checker's own `TypedCommons`, and some
//! `bynk-emit` site consumes — a service's protocol ([`ProtocolIr`]), a
//! handler's kind ([`IrHandlerKind`]) and route cache ([`CacheIr`]), a
//! `type` declaration's structure ([`TypeShape`]), an agent store field's
//! storage shape ([`StoreFieldIr`]/[`StoreKindIr`]), a
//! capability op's or attached method's signature ([`OpSig`]/[`FnSig`]), a
//! `given` capability reference ([`CapRefIr`]), an actor's authentication
//! seam ([`ActorSeamIr`]), an events subscription's pattern and shape
//! ([`EventPatternIr`]/[`EventPatternValueIr`]/[`EventSubscriberShape`]),
//! and the literal values a pattern can carry ([`ConstVal`]). Alongside
//! them: four AST-walk helpers `bynk-emit` reads ([`block_uses_emit`],
//! [`walk_block_exprs`], [`walk_exprs`], [`match_needs_if_chain`] — they
//! live here rather than in the emitter because they were written to be
//! shared with `bynk-lower`, and `bynk-emit` is the consumer that remains).
//!
//! **Every `pub` item here has a reader outside both `bynk-ir` and
//! `bynk-lower`**, and the gated `unconsumed_ir_items` probe
//! (`cargo xtask greenfield-status`) fails CI if one ever does not — the
//! two crates do not get to vouch for each other, since a `bynk-ir` type
//! constructed only by a `bynk-lower` helper nobody calls is exactly the
//! shape phase 6 shipped.
//!
//! **What this crate is not, and was.** Phase 6 of
//! `design/bynk-compiler-trajectory.md` (`the-ir.md`, #1137) built here a
//! full typed expression IR — `IrExpr`/`IrExprKind`/`IrStmt`, patterns and
//! match compilation, `IrItem` with every declaration variant, `IrHandler`,
//! `CommitShape` — and `bynk-lower` built the `&CheckedProgram → Ir` pass
//! that constructed it. The emitter never consumed any of it: its own
//! string-emitting lowerer kept reading the AST, and the one production
//! route into the IR constructors lowered every events-service handler body
//! and discarded the result. The follow-on track (the IR cutover,
//! #1542) priced finishing that cutover, found it was a second code
//! generator rather than a retype, and re-settled on deletion: Slices D0–D2
//! removed the detour, the constructors and those 23 types. The refusal is
//! recorded with a trigger in `design/bynk-greenfield-compiler.md` Part 15.1
//! (Slice D3). `design/archive/retired-tracks.md` has both tracks' closing
//! summaries.
//!
//! **Identity fields are adapted, not literal** (Decision B of P6.1,
//! extending ADR 0333's own precedent): the reference's
//! `DefId`/`FieldId`/`VariantId` arena does not exist in this codebase, so
//! every such slot is whatever cheap resolved handle the checker already
//! has — a [`TyId`] for a type, a `String` for a name with no arena of its
//! own.
//!
//! **Two AST types are embedded on purpose** (ADR 0366, P6.41):
//! [`TypeShape::Refined`] carries `bynk_syntax::ast::BaseType` and
//! `Refinement` directly, because the refinement predicate is rendered from
//! its syntax and an IR mirror would be a field-for-field copy with no
//! consumer of its own. The `ast_importers` probe's own doc comment
//! (`xtask/src/greenfield_status.rs`) records that this embedding is
//! invisible to it by construction.
