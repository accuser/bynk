//! Re-exports `bynk-ide`'s symbol logic (#808) — moved there so it's
//! reachable from `bynk-wasm` too, which can't depend on this crate's
//! `tower-lsp`/`tokio` stack. See `bynk_ide::symbols` for the real module.
//!
//! The one exception is the cross-file lookup trio below: `bynk-ide`'s
//! versions are `PathBuf`-keyed (wasm has no `Url`), so this crate re-wraps
//! them in the `Url` shape the LSP handlers actually use. Rust's shadowing
//! rule lets these locally-defined names win over the glob import.
