//! `bynkc-lsp` — Bynk Language Server.
//!
//! Implements the LSP capabilities listed in `design/bynk-lsp-spec.md` §4.3:
//! synchronisation (Full), diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition and -type/-impl,
//! formatting, document symbols, completion, signature help, references, rename,
//! code actions, code lens, call hierarchy, document links, inlay hints,
//! semantic tokens, workspace symbols, real multi-root workspace folders, and
//! server-registered file watching. Built on `tower-lsp`.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - [`Backend`] holds the server state (behind a `tokio::sync::RwLock`): a
//!   **map of projects** keyed by discovered root — each with its own config,
//!   analysis round, and published set — plus the workspace-folder discovery
//!   seeds and the client-global map of open documents. A request routes by URI
//!   to its project (its nearest enclosing `bynk.toml`); a file under none is
//!   single-file.
//! - Document changes trigger `schedule_diagnostics`, one generation-based
//!   debounce (a project-wide round via [`bynk_ide::diagnose_project_with`], or
//!   single-file [`bynk_ide::diagnose`]) that publishes the resulting
//!   diagnostics.
//! - Hover and definition consult the parsed AST for the file under the
//!   cursor; both are best-effort (return None for unrecognised positions).
//! - Formatting delegates to [`bynk_fmt::format_source`].
//!
//! Slice C (the `[lib]` seam): this crate exposes a library target so its
//! integration tests can `use bynk_lsp::…` instead of `#[path]`-including source
//! modules. The `pub mod`s below are exposed for that testing, **not** as a
//! stable API — `bynk-lsp` is a language-server binary and makes no library
//! compatibility promise.
