//! P4.2 (#1122), [DECISION E]: pins the six diagnostics categories that go
//! silently missing from the LSP's project analysis the moment `bynk-ide`
//! repoints off `bynk_emit::project::analyse_project_with` onto
//! `bynk_check::analysis::analyse_project` — the entry point P4.1 (#1115)
//! built, which is diagnostically faithful to `run_checks`'s `Mode::Analyse`
//! arm **minus** the categories this file pins (see
//! `bynk_check::analysis`'s own module doc comment for the full accounting).
//!
//! Each fixture below is copied from a real `bynkc/tests/fixtures/negative`
//! case that the CLI (`bynk_emit::project::compile_project`) rejects with
//! the named category — so each one is a *known-real* violation, not a
//! guess at one. This crate cannot depend on `bynk-emit` at all (R10.2,
//! enforced on `bynk-ide` at the manifest level, and mirrored here by
//! convention — see `bynk-lsp/Cargo.toml`'s own dependency comment), so
//! unlike `bynk-check/tests/differential_analysis.rs`'s
//! `new_entry_point_omits_test_body_diagnostics` these fixtures cannot
//! re-run the pre-repoint path for a live "before" comparison; each pin is
//! instead a direct assertion that today's `bynk_ide::diagnose_project`
//! output lacks the category a real violation would carry — "pin the gap as
//! an assertion, not an absence", per the tracking issue's own framing.
//!
//! **P5.0** (`design/tracks/semantics-in-the-checker.md` §6) closed two of
//! the five live regressions — `messages_bundle_diagnostic_present` and
//! `locale_bundle_ambiguity_diagnostic_present` are flipped to positive
//! coverage rather than deleted, per this module's own instruction below.
//! **P5.1** closed a third — `event_subscription_diagnostic_present`, same
//! treatment. **P5.2** closed a fourth —
//! `function_type_boundary_diagnostic_present`, same treatment. **P5.4**
//! closed the fifth and last — `test_body_diagnostics_and_index_bindings_go_missing`,
//! same treatment (its polarity genuinely flips, unlike
//! `platform_lock_diagnostic_stays_absent` below, which stays absent for an
//! unrelated hardcoding reason — see that test's own doc comment).
//!
//! **Correction found while grounding this fixture set.** The tracking
//! issue's [DECISION E] counted `check_platform_lock` among six *live*
//! regressions. Reading `lock_violation` (originally
//! `bynk-emit/src/project/validate.rs`; relocated at P5.3 to
//! `bynk-check/src/project_model.rs`, unchanged) shows its `Conflict` arm is
//! "not yet reachable end-to-end while only one platform ships native
//! capabilities" (the function's own doc comment) and its `Required` arm
//! fires only when the native platform disagrees with the *selected* one —
//! but `analyse_project_with` (the pre-repoint LSP path) always calls
//! `run_checks` with `Platform::default()` (Cloudflare) and
//! `BuildTarget::Bundle` hardcoded (`project.rs:743-744`), and
//! `bynk.cloudflare` is the *only* platform-native unit that exists
//! (`bynk_check::firstparty::platform_of`). So `first != selected` can never
//! hold under the LSP's own hardcoded call, for any project, both before and
//! after this slice — `check_platform_lock` was already a gap in name only,
//! exactly like schema-registry reconciliation (category 1, which
//! `bynk_check::analysis`'s own doc comment already excludes for the
//! identical reason). `platform_lock_diagnostic_stays_absent` below pins
//! that non-regression directly, rather than a repoint-caused one. **P5.3**
//! relocated both `check_platform_lock` (as
//! `bynk_check::project_model::phase_platform_lock`) and schema-registry
//! reconciliation (as `bynk_check::schema_registry::reconcile`) into
//! `bynk-check`, wiring both into `analyse_project` — R3.5 compliance, not a
//! behaviour change: the reasoning above for why platform-lock can never fire
//! on this path holds regardless of which crate the check's code lives in,
//! so `platform_lock_diagnostic_stays_absent` needs no change, and no
//! equivalent pin ever existed for schema-registry reconciliation (never
//! counted among the six — the same "gap in name only" reasoning applied to
//! it from the start, per `bynk_check::analysis`'s own doc).
//!
//! **P5.5** found a seventh site the six-category accounting above never
//! covered: `bynk.secrets.computed_name`, real production code whose own
//! comment claimed it reached the editor via `run_checks`'s `Mode::Analyse`
//! arm — true before P4.2's repoint, silently false after. Unlike the six
//! above, this one had no pin here (it was never counted as a live
//! regression, because nobody had re-derived its reachability since the
//! repoint) — `secrets_computed_name_diagnostic_stays_absent` below adds one
//! now that P5.5 has relocated and re-wired it, landing in the
//! `platform_lock_diagnostic_stays_absent` bucket (gap in name only, same
//! `BuildTarget::Bundle`-hardcoding reason) rather than the five genuinely
//! live ones.
