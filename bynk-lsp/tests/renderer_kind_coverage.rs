//! v0.166 (#616, ADR 0191): every `SymbolKind` the index resolves has a hover
//! renderer — mechanically, not by inspection.
//!
//! Hover's rung 1 resolves an offset through the project index and then *guards*
//! on the renderer returning `Some`. A resolved key with no arm therefore falls
//! through to the later, name-matching rungs — silently, and often to a
//! confidently wrong answer rather than to nothing. That has now shipped twice:
//! #611 gap B (a record `Field` label rendered a same-named handler param), and
//! #616 (`Method` rendered whichever same-named method was declared first;
//! `CapabilityOp` rendered the embedded stdlib op; `Actor` rendered nothing).
//!
//! Both times the arm was missing and nothing failed. This is the tooth ADR 0191
//! names in its Consequences, fitted rather than deferred to a third occurrence.
//! It has two halves, and needs both:
//!
//! - [`every_indexed_symbol_has_a_renderer`] is the **invariant**: sweep every
//!   key the real index produces for a fixture declaring all ten kinds, and fail
//!   on any the renderer answers `None` for. This is what would have caught #611
//!   gap B and all three of #616.
//! - [`declared_name`]'s `match` is the **forcing function**: it is exhaustive
//!   over `SymbolKind`, so adding a variant stops this crate compiling until
//!   someone names a declaration for it. Without that, a new kind the fixture
//!   never declares would leave the sweep quietly vacuous — passing while
//!   covering nothing, which is the failure mode the sweep exists to prevent.
