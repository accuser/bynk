//! #619 (v0.168): go-to-definition's same-file rung answers for an `actor`.
//!
//! `find_declaration_span` is rung 3 of go-to-definition's ladder (index →
//! locals → **same-file** → cross-file). It listed an arm per `CommonsItem`
//! variant and omitted `Actor`, and a `_ => {}` catch-all swallowed the miss —
//! so the `User` in `by u: User` resolved to nothing.
//!
//! The index rung above it resolves `SymbolKind::Actor` and normally answers
//! first, which is why this went unseen: it bites only where the index has not
//! resolved the offset — an unanalysed or mid-edit buffer, or a file outside the
//! analysed project. That reachability is also what these tests must work
//! around: driving the ladder would measure the index rung, not this one, so
//! they call `find_declaration_span` directly.
//!
//! Per ADR 0190 D6 the fixtures are *reference* offsets in real projects, read
//! from real `diagnose_project` output — `examples/todo/src/todos.bynk` for the
//! actor (the file the gap reproduces in), the compiler's own method-index
//! fixture for the divergence [`a_method_still_answers_to_its_bare_name`] pins.
//! `Backend::identifier_at` is transport-bound (it reads the open-document map)
//! and cannot be called from here, so [`name_at`] reproduces its one relevant
//! step — the token covering the offset — to turn an offset into the name the
//! rung is asked for.
//!
//! bynk-lsp is a binary crate: include the pure module directly (the pattern
//! `legend_drift.rs` established).
//!
//! This file is `exclude`d from the published `bynk-lsp` crate (Cargo.toml) —
//! `examples/todo` and the compiler's fixtures live outside this crate's
//! package, so a standalone `cargo test` on the published crate must not see
//! it. Skipping when a root is absent is not the alternative: ADR 0190 D6
//! requires these to read real output, and a skip could pass vacuously in-repo.
